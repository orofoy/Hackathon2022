1
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,055
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,432
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,227
With all due respect,

4
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,978
the ambassadors
for the Supreme Chancellor

5
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,480
wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,482
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,819
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal,

8
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:21,031
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:48,142
This way, please.

11
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:57,443
We are greatly honored by your visit,
Ambassadors.

12
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,111
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,780
My master will be with you shortly.

14
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:08,078
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:11,123
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:15,252
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:17,504
Don't center on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:21,008
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,886
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,888
But not at the expense of the moment.

21
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:29,057
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,101
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:34,938
How do you think this trade viceroy

24
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,857
will deal with
the chancellor's demands?

25
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,109
These Federation types are cowards.

26
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:42,154
The negotiations will be short.

27
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,574
What? What did you say?

28
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:48,494
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

29
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:50,496
I knew it.

30
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,956
They're here to force a settlement.

31
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,503
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

32
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,129
Are you brain-dead?

33
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,549
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

34
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,135
Send a droid.

35
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,934
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

36
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:14,645
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear

37
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,271
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

38
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,743
What is it?

39
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:32,663
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

40
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,458
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

41
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:41,421
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime
in my sight again.

42
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,925
This turn of events is unfortunate.

43
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:49,513
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

44
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:53,433
My lord, is that legal?

45
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,602
! Will make it legal.

46
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,146
And the Jedi?

47
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:01,108
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

48
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:02,693
Kill them immediately.

49
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:07,030
Yes. Yes, my lord. As you wish.

50
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,617
Captain, look!

51
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,078
Shields up!

52
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:18,667
Sorry.

53
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:23,547
Dioxis.

54
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:29,595
They must be dead by now.

55
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:32,431
Destroy what's left of them.

56
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:42,941
Oh. Excuse me.

57
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:44,651
Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.

58
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,153
Roger, roger.

59
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,780
Uh-oh. Blast them.

60
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:55,996
What is going on down there?

61
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,040
We lost the transmission, sir.

62
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,797
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

63
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:08,884
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

64
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,011
- Yes, Sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

65
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,639
I want droidekas up here at once!

66
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,183
We will not survive this.

67
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,154
Close the blast doors!

68
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:37,955
That will hold them.

69
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,216
They are still coming through.

70
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,176
This is impossible!

71
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,642
Where are those droidekas?

72
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,853
Master! Destroyers!

73
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,820
They have shield generators!

74
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,531
It's a standoff. Let's go.

75
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:20,747
They're no match for droidekas.

76
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:25,210
Sir! They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

77
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,847
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

78
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,934
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

79
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,312
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

80
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:45,814
Let's split up.

81
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:49,317
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

82
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:51,236
You were right about one thing, Master.

83
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,782
The negotiations were short.

84
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,619
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

85
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,830
It's Queen Amidala herself.

86
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:05,208
At last we are getting results.

87
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,754
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

88
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:10,005
You will not be so pleased

89
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,923
when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

90
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:15,802
Your trade boycott of our planet
has ended.

91
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,138
I was not aware of such failure.

92
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,058
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now

93
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,894
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

94
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:26,396
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

95
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,815
You must be mistaken.

96
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,901
Beware, Viceroy.

97
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:33,737
The Federation has gone
too far this time.

98
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:37,908
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

99
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:40,786
You assume too much.

100
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,287
We will see.

101
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,876
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

102
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,712
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

103
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:56,218
But we must move quickly to
disrupt all communications down there.

104
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:03,100
Negotiations
haven't started because

105
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:04,643
the ambassadors aren't there?

106
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,770
How could that be true?

107
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:10,774
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

108
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,443
It must... Handiwork...

109
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,362
Negotiate... Ambassadors...

110
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,156
- Nobody would...
- Senator Palpatine.

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,492
What's happening?

112
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:21,868
Check the transmission generator.

113
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:26,832
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing. Invasion.

114
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,334
The Federation would not
dare go that far.

115
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,878
The senate would
revoke their trade franchise,

116
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,463
and they'd be finished.

117
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,133
We must continue
to rely on negotiation.

118
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:39,761
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

119
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,055
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

120
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,934
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

121
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,103
Our security volunteers
will be no match

122
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:50,230
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

123
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:56,403
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

124
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:35,192
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship,

125
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,485
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

126
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,322
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

127
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,074
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

128
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,078
Use caution. These Jedi
are not to be underestimated.

129
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,053
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

130
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,555
Get down!

131
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,194
Was'n dat? Hey, wait!

132
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:21,238
Mooie-mooie! I love you!

133
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:23,657
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

134
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,908
I spake.

135
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:27,661
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

136
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:30,664
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

137
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,833
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

138
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,044
- That won't be necessary.
- But it 'is.

139
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:39,047
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

140
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,967
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

141
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,226
You saved my again.

142
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,228
- What's this?
- A local.

143
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:55,730
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

144
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,023
More?

145
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,150
"More" did you spake?

146
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:04,239
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

147
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:07,450
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

148
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:10,954
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

149
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,706
Can you take us there?

150
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:15,208
Uh... On second thought, no.

151
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:18,044
- Not really, no.
- No?

152
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,046
"Tis embarrassing,

153
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,134
but, my afraid my've been banished.

154
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:27,595
My forgotten.
Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

155
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,097
Terrible tings to me

156
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,224
if me goen back dare.

157
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,935
- You hear that?
- Yah.

158
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,814
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

159
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:40,317
If they find us, they will crush us,

160
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:45,155
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

161
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:46,740
Ah.

162
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:49,075
Yousa point is well seen.

163
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,661
This way. Hurry!

164
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,003
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

165
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,546
My warning you.

166
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:06,509
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

167
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:10,555
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

168
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,609
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

169
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:11,032
So good bein home!

170
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,258

How wude.

176
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,705
Yousa cannot bees hair.

177
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:03,334
Dis army of Mackineeks up dare
IS new weesong.

178
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:08,089
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

179
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,093
Wesa no like da Naboo.

180
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,846
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

181
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,932
Day tink day brains so big.

182
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:20,185
Once those droids
take control of the surface,

183
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:22,270
they will take control of you.

184
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:24,731
Mesa no tink so.

185
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:27,442
Day not know of uss-en.

186
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,778
You and the Naboo
form a symbiont circle.

187
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,530
What happens to one of you
will affect the other.

188
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,240
You must understand this.

189
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:39,078
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

190
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,706
Then speed us on our way.

191
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,375
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

192
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,128
We could use a transport.

193
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:50,340
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

194
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:53,301
- Huh?
- Da speediest way tooda Naboo

195
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,181
'tis goen through the planet core.

196
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:00,266
Now...

197
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,101
Go.

198
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,437
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

199
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:06,898
Master, what's a bongo?

200
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,983
A transport, I hope.

201
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,069
Deysa setten yousa up.

202
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,948
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

203
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:19,035
Any help here would be hot.

204
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,330
Master, we're short on time.

205
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:26,125
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

206
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,127
This Gungan may be of help.

207
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,633
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

208
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:38,221
Hisen to be pune-ished.

209
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,640
I saved his life.

210
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,351
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

211
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:47,230
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

212
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:49,857
Binkssssss,

213
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:54,529
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

214
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:55,613
Uh-huh.

215
00:17:00,577 --> 00:17:02,370
Begone wit him!

216
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,333
Count me outta dis one.

217
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:10,837
Better dead here than dead in da core.

218
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,090
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

219
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:35,111
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

220
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:38,197
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o,

221
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:43,369
buta small part of it
would be mesa clumsy.

222
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:45,455
You were banished
because you were clumsy?

223
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:48,333
Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

224
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:05,475
Mesa caused mabbe
one, two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

225
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,894
Yud-say boom da gassar,

226
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:10,563
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

227
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:15,985
Oh!

228
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:19,822
Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

229
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,837
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

230
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:49,352
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

231
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:52,563
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

232
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:57,276
They will have no choice but to
accept your control of the system.

233
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,781
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

234
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:05,201
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

235
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:08,496
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

236
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,540
Yes, my lord.

237
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,128
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

238
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:20,091
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

239
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:27,974
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

240
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,685
Maxi big, da Force.

241
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,521
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

242
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,815
We're losing power.

243
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,483
Oh, no!

244
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,533
Wesa dyin' here.

245
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:48,536
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

246
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:51,414
Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.

247
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:56,502
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

248
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,089
- Power's back.
- Huh?

249
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,300
Monster's back!

250
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,809
Relax.

251
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:13,519
You overdid it.

252
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,537
- Horrible.
- Head for that outcropping.

253
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:34,332
Oh, boy.

254
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:11,702
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

255
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:14,831
Ah. Victory.

256
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:29,846
Dis'n loverly.

257
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:38,729
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

258
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:43,109
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

259
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,571
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

260
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:50,157
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

261
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,034
In time, the suffering of your people

262
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:54,287
will persuade you
to see our point of view.

263
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:57,665
- Commander.
- Yes, Sir.

264
00:21:57,748 --> 00:22:01,252
- Process them.
- Captain, take them to Camp 4.

265
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:03,296
Roger, roger.

266
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,519
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

267
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:01,812
Get their weapons.

268
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:05,650
Whoa! Yousa guys bombad!

269
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,737
We're ambassadors
for the Supreme Chancellor.

270
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,781
Your negotiations
seemed to have failed, Ambassador.

271
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,824
The negotiations never took place.

272
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:16,369
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

273
00:23:16,452 --> 00:23:18,663
They've knocked out
all our communications.

274
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:19,872
Do you have transports?

275
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,791
In the main hangar. This way.

276
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:30,049
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

277
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:31,676
Your Highness,
under the circumstances,

278
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,678
I suggest
you come to Coruscant with us.

279
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,931
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

280
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:39,642
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

281
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,436
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

282
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,729
They can't afford to kill her.

283
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,731
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

284
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,817
There's no logic in
the Federation's move here.

285
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,902
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

286
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,655
Our only hope is
for the senate to side with us.

287
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:54,991
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

288
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:59,328
Either choice
presents great danger to us all.

289
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:01,038
We are brave, Your Highness.

290
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:04,625
If you are to leave, Your Highness,
it must be now.

291
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:07,086
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

292
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:09,922
Be careful, Governor.

293
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:22,101
We'll need to free those pilots.

294
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,270
I'll deal with that.

295
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,566
Halt!

296
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:30,192
I'm ambassador
to the Supreme Chancellor.

297
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:32,111
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

298
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:35,489
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

299
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:38,367
Coruscant? That doesn't compute.

300
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,161
Wait. You're under arrest.

301
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,751
Come on. Move!

302
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,466
Go!

303
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:22,495
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

304
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:28,959
Hello, boyos.

305
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:36,008
There's the blockade.

306
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,062
The shield generator's been hit!

307
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:58,072
How wude!

308
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:09,834
We're losing droids fast.

309
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:13,212
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

310
00:26:15,422 --> 00:26:16,799
The shields are gone.

311
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:26,016
The power's back!

312
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,356
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

313
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:34,859
Deflector shields up at maximum.

314
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,495
There's not enough power
to get us to Coruscant.

315
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,330
The hyperdrive is leaking.

316
00:26:48,622 --> 00:26:51,375
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

317
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,836
Here, Master. Tatooine.

318
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,421
Small, out of the way, poor.

319
00:26:55,504 --> 00:26:57,548
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

320
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,341
How can you be sure?

321
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:01,468
It's controlled by the Hutts.

322
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,095
You can't take
Her Royal Highness there.

323
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,430
The Hutts are gangsters.

324
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:05,556
If they discovered her...

325
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:06,682
It'd be no different than if we landed

326
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:08,851
on a system
controlled by the Federation,

327
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:10,895
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her,

328
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:13,522
which gives us the advantage.

329
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,738
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

330
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,617
She has disappeared, my lord.

331
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,787
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

332
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,957
! Want that treaty signed.

333
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,293
My lord,

334
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,712
it's impossible to locate the ship.

335
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:38,881
It's out of our range.

336
00:27:38,964 --> 00:27:42,218
Not for a Sith.

337
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,969
This is my apprentice,

338
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,013
Darth Maul.

339
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:50,809
He will find your lost ship.

340
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,024
This is getting out of hand.

341
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,235
Now there are two of them.

342
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:02,655
We should not have made this bargain.

343
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:11,413
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

344
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:14,416
Without a doubt,
it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

345
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,670
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

346
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,508
R2-D2, Your Highness.

347
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:24,093
Thank you, R2-D2.

348
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,057
Padmé.

349
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,018
Clean this droid up as best you can.

350
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:35,020
It deserves our gratitude.

351
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,232
Continue, Captain.

352
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,569
Your Highness, with your permission,

353
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:45,948
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

354
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:49,410
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

355
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,246
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

356
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,624
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

357
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,045
Hello.

358
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:03,424
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

359
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:06,051
I'm Padmé.

360
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:09,138
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

361
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,181
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

362
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,642
Uh-huh.

363
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:17,104
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

364
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:21,025
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

365
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:24,069
Den boom! Getten berry scared

366
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:27,573
and grabben dat Jedi,
and pow, mesa here.

367
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:31,118
Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

368
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:40,711
- That's it. Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

369
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:44,631
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

370
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:05,027
The hyperdrive generator's gone,
Master. We'll need a new one.

371
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,613
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

372
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:10,699
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

373
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:13,660
Don't let them send any transmissions.

374
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,085
This sun doen murder to mesa skin.

375
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,128
Wait!

376
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:25,672
Wait.

377
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:31,720
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

378
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:35,682
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

379
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,893
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

380
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,104
The queen wishes it.

381
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,272
She's curious about the planet.

382
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:45,818
This is not a good idea.

383
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:47,986
Stay close to me.

384
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,086
Moisture farms, for the most part.

385
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:09,299
Some indigenous
tribes and scavengers.

386
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,176
The few spaceports like this one

387
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,887
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

388
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,931
Like us.

389
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,768
Dissen berry berry bad.

390
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:23,272
Oh! Icky icky goo!

391
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,287
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

392
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:52,311
I need parts for a ♪-type 327 Nubian.

393
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:56,524
Yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

394
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:01,278
My droid has a readout of what I need.

395
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,188
So, let me take
thee out back, huh?

396
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:16,857
You'll find what you need.

397
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,360
- Huh?
- Don't touch anything.

398
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:21,695
Mmm.

399
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:29,661
Hmm.

400
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:33,373
- Are you an angel?
- What?

401
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:37,211
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

402
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,339
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

403
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:43,008
They live on the moons of lego, I think.

404
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,344
You're a funny little boy.

405
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:47,262
How do you know so much?

406
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:51,225
I listen to all the traders and
star pilots who come through here.

407
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:56,021
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

408
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:59,942
- You're a pilot?
- Mmm-hmm. All my life.

409
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,277
How long have you been here?

410
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:06,198
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

411
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:09,326
My mom and I
were sold to Gardulla the Hutt,

412
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:12,246
but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

413
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:14,164
You're a slave?

414
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:18,335
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

415
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:22,214
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

416
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:23,548
Hmm.

417
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:29,137
Wheres yousa goin?

418
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:35,727
- I got ya.
- Hey!

419
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:38,021
- What?
- Hit the nose.

420
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,940
Oh.

421
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:46,196
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

422
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,199
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

423
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:52,619
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

424
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,872
Saying of which,

425
00:33:55,956 --> 00:33:58,208
how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

426
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,294
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

427
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:02,212
Republic credits?

428
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:05,424
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

429
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:08,552
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

430
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:12,306
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

431
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,224
No, they won't!

432
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,310
What, you think
you're some kind of Jedi,

433
00:34:16,393 --> 00:34:18,353
waving your hand around like that?

434
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:22,941
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

435
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:27,321
No money, no parts, no deal.

436
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:31,825
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

437
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,419
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

438
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:48,967
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

439
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:53,764
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

440
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,724
I was glad to meet you too.

441
00:34:57,893 --> 00:34:59,853
What?

442
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:15,456
Yipee!

443
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:24,580
And you're sure
there's nothing left on board?

444
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,582
A few containers of supplies.

445
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:30,461
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

446
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:32,338
not in the amount you're talking about.

447
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,257
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

448
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,800
I'll check back later.

449
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,470
Noah gain! Noah gain.

450
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:42,306
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

451
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:45,017
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

452
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,103
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

453
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,408
Oh. Mooie-mooie.

454
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:03,160
Hey, hey!

455
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,647
Huh? Wanga?

456
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:15,990
Oops.

457
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:23,497
Who, mesa?

458
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,752
Ouch.

459
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,358
- Hi.
- Hi there.

460
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,694
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

461
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:54,613
He picked a fight with a Dug,

462
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,157
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

463
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,952
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da lasting mesa want.

464
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:05,248
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

465
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:07,042
Thanks, my young friend.

466
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,377
But... But...

467
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,463
But mesa doen nutten!

468
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:22,515
This storm will slow them down.

469
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,935
Looks pretty bad.

470
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,479
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

471
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:29,147
We'll be right there.

472
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:38,365
Here, you'll like these pallies.

473
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,909
- Here.
- Thank you.

474
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,496
Oh, my bones are aching.

475
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,084
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

476
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:52,295
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

477
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:55,298
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

478
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:57,384
You'll never reach the outskirts
in time.

479
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:01,513
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

480
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:04,808
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

481
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:19,864
Mom!

482
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:23,576
- Mom, I'm home!
- Oh. Dissen cozy.

483
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:26,162
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

484
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:29,791
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

485
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,377
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

486
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:35,880
- Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
- Oh. Mooie-mooie.

487
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:47,517
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

488
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,935
He's wonderful.

489
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,771
You really like him?

490
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,899
He's a protocol droid to help Mom.
Watch.

491
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:57,610
Oh.

492
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:00,780
Where is everybody?

493
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,034
Whoops. Yeah.

494
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:06,494
Oh. Hello.

495
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,789
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

496
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,666
How might I serve you?

497
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,793
- He's perfect.
- Perfect.

498
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:16,629
When the storm is over,
I'll show you my racer.

499
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:18,298
I'm building a Podracer.

500
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,427
I'm not sure
this floor is entirely stable.

501
00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:25,638
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

502
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,684
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

503
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:32,812
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

504
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:38,735
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

505
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,865
My parts are showing? My goodness!

506
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,705
The death toll is catastrophic.

507
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,166
We must bow to their wishes.

508
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,418
You must contact me.

509
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:58,421
It's a trick. Send no reply.

510
00:39:58,505 --> 00:40:01,007
Send no transmissions of any kind.

511
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:05,595
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

512
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:09,682
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

513
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,936
Either way, we're running out of time.

514
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,909
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

515
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,829
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

516
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:32,831
Move against the Jedi first.

517
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:36,126
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo

518
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:37,627
to sign the treaty.

519
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,963
At last we will
reveal ourselves to the Jedi.

520
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,757
At last we will have revenge.

521
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,760
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

522
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:48,179
They will be no match for you.

523
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:57,480
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

524
00:40:58,398 --> 00:41:01,025
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

525
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:04,821
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

526
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:07,365
- Boom!
- How wude!

527
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:09,868
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

528
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:11,911
The Republic's antislavery laws...

529
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:14,205
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

530
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:16,374
We must survive on our own.

531
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,919
Xcuse me.

532
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:23,756
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

533
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,261
They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

534
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,972
I'm the only human who can do it.

535
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:34,476
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

536
00:41:35,351 --> 00:41:37,061
Don't do that again.

537
00:41:42,025 --> 00:41:44,652
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

538
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:49,282
What makes you think that?

539
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:53,453
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

540
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:57,207
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

541
00:41:57,457 --> 00:41:58,625
I don't think so.

542
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:01,002
No one can Kill a Jedi.

543
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,838
I wish that were so.

544
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,840
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

545
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:09,093
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

546
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:12,722
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

547
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:17,060
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

548
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:24,734
I can see
there's no fooling you, Anakin.

549
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:27,904
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

550
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:29,948
on a very important mission.

551
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:33,368
How did you end up out here
in the Outer Rim?

552
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:37,038
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

553
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:39,082
I can help.

554
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,127
- I can fix anything.
- I believe you can.

555
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,880
But first we must
acquire the parts we need.

556
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,967
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

557
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,387
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

558
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:57,058
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

559
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:01,271
Podracing.
Greed can be a powerful ally.

560
00:43:01,563 --> 00:43:04,482
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

561
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:06,859
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

562
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:09,571
- You could enter my pod.
- Anakin!

563
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:13,032
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

564
00:43:13,116 --> 00:43:14,909
You could make him think it was yours

565
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,078
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

566
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:21,499
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

567
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,835
But, Mom, I love it.

568
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:27,338
The prize money would more
than pay for the parts they need.

569
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:29,882
Anakin.

570
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,802
Your mother's right.

571
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:36,014
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

572
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,058
No.

573
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:46,816
Mom, you say the biggest problem
in this universe

574
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:48,818
is nobody helps each other.

575
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:56,701
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

576
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,494
We'll find some other way.

577
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:00,997
No.

578
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,666
There is no other way.

579
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,004
I may not like it, but he can help you.

580
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:11,132
He was meant to help you.

581
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:26,064
Are you sure about this?

582
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:28,941
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

583
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,069
The queen will not approve.

584
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:33,905
The queen doesn't need to know.

585
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,866
Well, I don't approve.

586
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:39,619
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

587
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:44,332
How can you do this? Not on the
Republic credits, I think, huh?

588
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,168
My ship will be the entry fee.

589
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:49,253
Oh. Not bad!

590
00:44:49,337 --> 00:44:52,215
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

591
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:55,802
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

592
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,220
What would the boy ride?

593
00:44:57,303 --> 00:45:02,058
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

594
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:06,187
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

595
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:10,108
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

596
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:13,528
That you did, huh.

597
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:16,197
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

598
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:20,785
I have acquired a pod in a game
of chance, the fastest ever built.

599
00:45:21,244 --> 00:45:26,040
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

600
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:31,671
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee,

601
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:33,131
and I supply the boy.

602
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:37,135
We split the winnings,
50-50, I think, huh?

603
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:38,553
If it's going to be 50-50,

604
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,889
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

605
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,058
If we win,

606
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:47,979
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

607
00:45:48,062 --> 00:45:51,065
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

608
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,069
Either way, you win.

609
00:45:55,737 --> 00:45:56,946
Hmm...

610
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,827
Deal!

611
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,711
What if this plan fails, Master?

612
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:25,297
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

613
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,925
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

614
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:31,583
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

615
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,835
And...

616
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:36,796
There's something about this boy.

617
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,804
You should be very proud of your son.

618
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:47,974
He gives without any thought of reward.

619
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:51,102
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

620
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:55,148
- He has a...
- He has special powers.

621
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:57,984
Yes.

622
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:00,945
He can see things before they happen.

623
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:03,615
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

624
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:05,325
It's a Jedi trait.

625
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:07,494
He deserves
better than a slave's life.

626
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:08,578
Why, certainly.

627
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:12,123
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

628
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:18,338
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

629
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:20,215
Who was his father?

630
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:24,677
There was no father.

631
00:47:26,387 --> 00:47:29,557
I carried him, I gave birth,
I raised him.

632
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:32,977
I can't explain what happened.

633
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:36,231
Can you help him?

634
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:39,109
I don't know.

635
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:44,614
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

636
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,665
Hey, hi, Ani.

637
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:55,375
Hi.

638
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:59,504
Wow, a real astro droid.

639
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:05,385
- How did you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

640
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:08,471
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

641
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,056
With this?

642
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,113
You've been working
on that thing for years.

643
00:48:15,197 --> 00:48:16,490
It's never gonna run.

644
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:18,659
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

645
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:22,245
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

646
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:30,420
Hey, Jar Jar.

647
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,078
Keep away from those energy binders.

648
00:48:33,162 --> 00:48:36,415
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

649
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:38,167
Sorry. Okay.

650
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:44,506
My tongue is fat.

651
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,760
My tongue... Wrench.

652
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:50,304
Where is da wrench? Dare it is.

653
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:51,388
Hey.

654
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:56,560
Ani, I'm stuck. Ani...

655
00:48:56,935 --> 00:49:00,564
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

656
00:49:02,524 --> 00:49:05,402
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

657
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:07,446
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

658
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,948
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

659
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:11,950
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

660
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,286
My... My mouth.

661
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,662
Ani, I'm stuck.

662
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:23,087
Hey. My tongue is fat. Ani!

663
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:26,131
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

664
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:30,135
Thank you.

665
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:31,929
Go.

666
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,155
It's working! It's working!

667
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:03,293
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

668
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:07,506
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

669
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:09,383
Most of them.

670
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,593
Has anyone been to 'em all?

671
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:14,805
Not likely.

672
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:17,808
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

673
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:21,437
- Ani, bedtime!
- Ow.

674
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,064
There we are. Good as new.

675
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:27,151
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

676
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,779
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

677
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:34,366
Go on. You have a big day tomorrow.

678
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,618
Sleep well, Ani.

679
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:41,373
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

680
00:50:41,457 --> 00:50:43,959
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

681
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:46,628
Wait a minute.

682
00:50:47,671 --> 00:50:49,631
I need a midi-chlorian count.

683
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:55,596
The reading is off the chart.

684
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,139
Over 20,000.

685
00:50:57,347 --> 00:51:01,059
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

686
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:02,686
No Jedi has.

687
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,980
What does that mean?

688
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:07,691
I'm not sure.

689
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:20,472
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

690
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:22,099
Patience, my blue friend.

691
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,685
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

692
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:26,645
And we'll be far away from here.

693
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:30,691
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

694
00:52:30,774 --> 00:52:34,319
I warn you, no funny business.

695
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:37,864
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrong, no.

696
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:40,158
I have great faith in the boy.

697
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:42,035
He's a credit to your race,

698
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,706
but Sebulba there is going to win,
I think.

699
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,418
Oh, no!

700
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:55,507
Why do you think that?

701
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,093
He always wins!

702
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,763
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

703
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,977
- I'll take that bet.
- You what?

704
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:10,731
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say,

705
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:12,733
the boy and his mother.

706
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:16,361
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

707
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,947
The boy, then.

708
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:21,783
Well...

709
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:27,831
We'll let fate decide, huh?

710
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:31,376
I just happen to
have a chance cube here.

711
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:34,671
Blue, it's the boy.

712
00:53:34,755 --> 00:53:38,717
Red, his mother.

713
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:52,773
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

714
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:55,400
So it makes little difference!

715
00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:16,564
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

716
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:18,316
Good morning.

717
00:54:19,775 --> 00:54:20,818
Oh, my.

718
00:54:20,902 --> 00:54:22,904
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

719
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:28,840
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

720
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:32,302
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

721
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:36,848
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

722
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:41,394
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

723
00:54:41,894 --> 00:54:43,479
Not even finished?

724
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:46,107
Kitster's right. I will this time.

725
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:48,234
Of course you will.

726
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:17,764
...Podracers.

727
00:55:17,972 --> 00:55:19,599
That's absolutely right.

728
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:25,271
And a big turnout here from all
corners of the Outer Rim Territories.

729
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:29,359
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

730
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,988
ANNOUNCER 2 I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund system.

731
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:41,788
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

732
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:45,917
Sebulba!

733
00:55:56,678 --> 00:55:59,764
And in the front row,
nearside pole position,

734
00:55:59,847 --> 00:56:01,808
Mawhonic!

735
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,019
A hearty hello

736
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:08,940
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

737
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,946
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt

738
00:56:15,029 --> 00:56:19,742
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

739
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:25,540
And hoping for a big win today,

740
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:30,712
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

741
00:56:34,882 --> 00:56:37,969
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker,

742
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:40,805
a local boy.

743
00:56:42,014 --> 00:56:44,392
I see the flags
are moving out onto the track.

744
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,612
Huh?

745
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:01,492
Pee yousa!

746
00:57:04,704 --> 00:57:06,038
Be safe.

747
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:09,500
I will, Mom. I promise.

748
00:57:19,427 --> 00:57:21,554
Uh-oh.

749
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,396
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

750
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:44,439
- Right.
- Whoa.

751
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,154
Remember,
concentrate on the moment.

752
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:54,950
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

753
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:56,535
I will.

754
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,371
May the Force be with you.

755
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,798
Jabba the Hutt.

756
00:58:39,468 --> 00:58:42,763
Hey, it looks like
they're clearing the grid.

757
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:45,849
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

758
00:58:47,476 --> 00:58:50,271
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

759
00:58:50,354 --> 00:58:53,107
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

760
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,609
You should too.

761
00:58:55,693 --> 00:58:57,695
You assume too much.

762
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:01,573
Start your engines.

763
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:43,407
Dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

764
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:06,263
Oh, no! No!

765
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:13,604
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

766
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:28,327
Well, it looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

767
01:00:29,995 --> 01:00:31,205
Come on, Ani!

768
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:40,964
- And there goes Skywalker!
- Go, Ani, go!

769
01:00:41,048 --> 01:00:43,258
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

770
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,042
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders

771
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:02,504
are camped out
on the Canyon Dune turn.

772
01:02:14,016 --> 01:02:17,478
Ooh. There goes
Quadinaros' power coupling.

773
01:02:45,756 --> 01:02:47,424
Oh, no!

774
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:54,765
Where is Master Anakin?

775
01:02:57,851 --> 01:02:59,520
Look. Here he comes.

776
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:04,858
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

777
01:03:14,535 --> 01:03:16,912
He has to complete two more circuits?

778
01:03:16,995 --> 01:03:18,163
Oh, dear.

779
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:12,634
Ha!

780
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:27,608
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

781
01:05:25,832 --> 01:05:29,544
! Don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

782
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,553
Here he comes!

783
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,222
At the start of the final lap,

784
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:41,306
Sebulba's in the lead,

785
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,267
followed closely by Skywalker!

786
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:45,352
Go, Ani!

787
01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:14,631
Skywalker's been
forced onto the service ramp!

788
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:39,865
- It's Skywalker!
- Sebulba!

789
01:06:40,198 --> 01:06:44,536
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

790
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:46,079
Did he crash-ed?

791
01:07:27,037 --> 01:07:30,248
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

792
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:25,971
He's catching Sebulba!

793
01:08:26,304 --> 01:08:28,640
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

794
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,298
That little human being
is out of his mind.

795
01:09:02,549 --> 01:09:03,592
They're side by side!

796
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,170
I can't believe it.

797
01:09:40,253 --> 01:09:42,172
The crowds are going nuts!

798
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:53,308
Yay, Ani!

799
01:09:54,643 --> 01:09:57,437
Mom, I did it! Yeah!

800
01:10:07,948 --> 01:10:09,866
Good going, Ani!

801
01:10:14,454 --> 01:10:16,206
We owe you everything, Ani.

802
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,961
It's so wonderful, Ani.

803
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:23,797
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

804
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,050
I'm so very proud of you.

805
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:38,645
You.

806
01:10:38,937 --> 01:10:40,897
You swindled me!

807
01:10:40,981 --> 01:10:45,068
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

808
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:46,861
I lost everything.

809
01:10:47,278 --> 01:10:50,615
Whenever you gamble,
my friend, eventually you'll lose.

810
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:53,243
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

811
01:10:53,326 --> 01:10:56,329
I'll come by your shop later on
SO you can release the boy.

812
01:10:56,621 --> 01:11:00,000
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

813
01:11:02,711 --> 01:11:05,630
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

814
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:08,216
I'm sure they can settle this.

815
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,012
Take him.

816
01:11:18,977 --> 01:11:20,895
Hidoe!

817
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,024
Well, we have
all the essential parts we need.

818
01:11:24,107 --> 01:11:27,027
I'm going back. Some unfinished
business. I won't be long.

819
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:30,697
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

820
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:34,701
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

821
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:36,828
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

822
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:39,247
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

823
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,458
Come on. Hup!

824
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:49,507
Hey. These are yours.

825
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,301
Yes!

826
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:54,512
Mom, we sold the pod!

827
01:11:54,596 --> 01:11:56,681
- Look at all the money we have!
- My goodness!

828
01:11:56,765 --> 01:12:00,226
- But that's so wonderful, Ani.
- And he has been freed.

829
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,063
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

830
01:12:05,231 --> 01:12:06,900
Did you hear that?

831
01:12:07,776 --> 01:12:10,153
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

832
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:12,906
You are free.

833
01:12:16,659 --> 01:12:17,994
Will you take him with you?

834
01:12:18,078 --> 01:12:21,081
- Is he to become a Jedi?
- Yes.

835
01:12:21,164 --> 01:12:24,959
Our meeting was not a coincidence.
Nothing happens by accident.

836
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:28,713
You mean I get to come
with you in your starship?

837
01:12:28,963 --> 01:12:30,882
Anakin,

838
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:35,595
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

839
01:12:35,678 --> 01:12:38,431
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

840
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:41,643
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

841
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:44,646
Can I go, Mom?

842
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:47,315
Anakin,

843
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:50,527
this path has been placed before you.

844
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,821
The choice is yours alone.

845
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,535
I wanna do it.

846
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,413
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

847
01:13:02,497 --> 01:13:03,581
Yipee.

848
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,506
What about Mom?

849
01:13:14,759 --> 01:13:16,511
Is she free too?

850
01:13:16,761 --> 01:13:20,056
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

851
01:13:21,015 --> 01:13:24,102
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

852
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:34,362
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

853
01:13:34,737 --> 01:13:37,907
It is time for you to let go.

854
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:40,201
I don't want things to change.

855
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:42,954
But you can't stop the change

856
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:46,833
any more than you can stop the suns
from setting.

857
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,127
I love you.

858
01:13:54,757 --> 01:13:56,718
Now hurry.

859
01:14:02,098 --> 01:14:03,641
Thank you.

860
01:14:03,725 --> 01:14:06,644
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

861
01:14:08,605 --> 01:14:11,065
Will you be all right?

862
01:14:11,482 --> 01:14:13,067
Yeah.

863
01:14:16,613 --> 01:14:17,989
Oh, my.

864
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,699
Hello, Master Anakin.

865
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:21,868
Well, 3PO, I've been freed

866
01:14:22,243 --> 01:14:24,662
and I'm going away in a starship.

867
01:14:24,746 --> 01:14:27,498
Master Anakin,
you are my maker and I wish you well.

868
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,920
However, I should prefer it
If 1 were a little more completed.

869
01:14:32,128 --> 01:14:37,258
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you,
3PO, give you coverings and all.

870
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:41,679
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

871
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:44,307
I'll make sure
Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

872
01:14:45,016 --> 01:14:46,142
Sell me?

873
01:14:46,226 --> 01:14:48,102
Bye.

874
01:14:48,436 --> 01:14:50,355
Oh, my.

875
01:15:14,087 --> 01:15:16,297
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

876
01:15:16,798 --> 01:15:18,383
Ani.

877
01:15:20,677 --> 01:15:22,553
Will I ever see you again?

878
01:15:24,222 --> 01:15:26,891
What does your heart tell you?

879
01:15:28,226 --> 01:15:30,728
I hope so.

880
01:15:30,812 --> 01:15:32,730
Yes.

881
01:15:32,814 --> 01:15:34,440
I guess.

882
01:15:35,191 --> 01:15:38,361
Then we will see each other again.

883
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:43,658
I will come back and free you, Mom.

884
01:15:43,741 --> 01:15:45,451
I promise.

885
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:56,713
Now, be brave,

886
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,465
and don't look back.

887
01:16:00,216 --> 01:16:02,343
Don't look back.

888
01:16:46,763 --> 01:16:49,599
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

889
01:16:52,393 --> 01:16:54,937
Go! Tell them to take off!

890
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:10,620
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

891
01:17:11,412 --> 01:17:12,872
Take off.

892
01:17:13,456 --> 01:17:15,249
Over there. Fly low.

893
01:17:37,063 --> 01:17:38,564
Are you all right?

894
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:40,066
I think so.

895
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:41,692
What was it?

896
01:17:41,776 --> 01:17:46,197
I'm not sure, but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

897
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,783
My guess is it was after the queen.

898
01:17:49,033 --> 01:17:51,202
What are we gonna do about it?

899
01:17:53,496 --> 01:17:55,415
We shall be patient.

900
01:17:55,498 --> 01:17:58,584
Anakin Skywalker,
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

901
01:17:58,668 --> 01:18:00,378
Hi.

902
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:04,215
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

903
01:18:11,973 --> 01:18:14,767
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving,

904
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:16,811
and you, Governor, are going to die

905
01:18:16,894 --> 01:18:19,313
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

906
01:18:19,397 --> 01:18:21,816
This invasion will gain you nothing.

907
01:18:21,899 --> 01:18:24,944
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

908
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:26,988
Take him away.

909
01:18:30,366 --> 01:18:32,910
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps

910
01:18:32,994 --> 01:18:35,246
for these rumored underwater villages.

911
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:38,040
They will not stay hidden for long.

912
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,888
The death toll is catastrophic.

913
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,557
We must bow to their wishes.

914
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,185
You must contact me.

915
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:12,992
You all right?

916
01:19:13,993 --> 01:19:16,162
It's very cold.

917
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:26,881
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

918
01:19:26,964 --> 01:19:29,258
A little too warm for my taste.

919
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:31,511
Space is cold.

920
01:19:31,886 --> 01:19:33,679
You seem sad.

921
01:19:35,139 --> 01:19:37,475
The queen is worried.

922
01:19:37,558 --> 01:19:39,644
Her people are suffering, dying.

923
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:43,397
She must convince
the senate to intervene, or...

924
01:19:45,066 --> 01:19:47,109
I'm not sure what'll happen.

925
01:19:48,528 --> 01:19:50,655
I made this for you...

926
01:19:52,323 --> 01:19:53,991
So you'd remember me.

927
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:57,411
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

928
01:19:57,828 --> 01:20:00,331
It'll bring you good fortune.

929
01:20:00,414 --> 01:20:02,333
It's beautiful.

930
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,877
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

931
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:12,134
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

932
01:20:12,218 --> 01:20:14,554
but my caring for you will remain.

933
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:20,560
I care for you, too, only I...

934
01:20:20,935 --> 01:20:22,562
Miss your mother.

935
01:20:41,455 --> 01:20:45,334
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

936
01:20:45,543 --> 01:20:47,336
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

937
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:50,715
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

938
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:23,164
It is a great gift to see you alive,
Your Majesty.

939
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,292
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

940
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,919
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

941
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:31,547
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

942
01:21:31,631 --> 01:21:35,801
Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

943
01:21:36,135 --> 01:21:37,470
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

944
01:21:37,553 --> 01:21:41,432
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

945
01:21:41,515 --> 01:21:44,602
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

946
01:21:45,603 --> 01:21:49,023
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

947
01:21:49,106 --> 01:21:53,486
There is a question of procedure,
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

948
01:21:54,445 --> 01:21:56,447
I must speak
with the Jedi Council immediately.

949
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:59,408
The situation has become
much more complicated.

950
01:22:05,373 --> 01:22:07,041
Ani, come on.

951
01:22:18,302 --> 01:22:22,473
The queen's a bein'
grossly nice, mesa finks.

952
01:22:22,556 --> 01:22:24,183
Pitty hot.

953
01:22:52,378 --> 01:22:56,716
There is no civility,
only politics.

954
01:22:56,799 --> 01:23:00,720
The Republic is not what it once was.

955
01:23:00,803 --> 01:23:05,850
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

956
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:10,146
There is no interest
in the common good.

957
01:23:10,938 --> 01:23:12,648
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

958
01:23:12,732 --> 01:23:15,651
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

959
01:23:15,735 --> 01:23:18,654
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

960
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:22,616
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

961
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:26,620
He is mired by
baseless accusations of corruption.

962
01:23:26,704 --> 01:23:30,499
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

963
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:34,378
Our best choice would be
to push for the election

964
01:23:34,462 --> 01:23:36,380
of a stronger Supreme Chancellor,

965
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:38,716
one who could control the bureaucrats

966
01:23:39,175 --> 01:23:40,718
and give us justice.

967
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:45,639
You could call for
a vote of no confidence

968
01:23:45,723 --> 01:23:47,016
in Chancellor Valorum.

969
01:23:47,391 --> 01:23:49,685
He has been our strongest supporter.

970
01:23:49,769 --> 01:23:54,982
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

971
01:23:55,816 --> 01:23:58,527
The courts take even longer to
decide things than the senate.

972
01:23:59,528 --> 01:24:01,530
Our people are dying, Senator.

973
01:24:02,198 --> 01:24:05,367
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

974
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:08,287
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

975
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:13,250
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

976
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:17,797
That is something I cannot do.

977
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,931
He was trained
in the Jedi arts.

978
01:24:27,097 --> 01:24:30,976
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

979
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:35,272
Impossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

980
01:24:35,606 --> 01:24:39,735
I do not believe the Sith could have
returned without us knowing.

981
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:42,780
Ah. Hard to see, the dark side is.

982
01:24:43,364 --> 01:24:45,783
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

983
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:49,662
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

984
01:24:49,745 --> 01:24:50,955
May the Force be with you.

985
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:56,585
Master Qui-Gon.

986
01:24:57,294 --> 01:24:59,922
More to say have you?

987
01:25:01,048 --> 01:25:03,551
With your permission, my master,

988
01:25:04,844 --> 01:25:07,680
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

989
01:25:08,722 --> 01:25:10,766
A vergence, you say?

990
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:13,018
Located around a person?

991
01:25:13,352 --> 01:25:14,728
A boy.

992
01:25:14,812 --> 01:25:16,730
His cells have the highest concentration

993
01:25:16,814 --> 01:25:18,941
of midi-chlorians
I have seen in a life-form.

994
01:25:19,024 --> 01:25:21,986
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

995
01:25:23,863 --> 01:25:24,947
You refer to the prophecy

996
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,575
of the one who
will bring balance to the Force.

997
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,494
You believe it's this boy?

998
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:33,205
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

999
01:25:33,956 --> 01:25:35,916
Revealed your opinion is.

1000
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,043
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1001
01:25:38,127 --> 01:25:39,461
Oh.

1002
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:43,424
Trained as a Jedi you request for him?

1003
01:25:43,883 --> 01:25:46,218
Finding him was the will of the Force.

1004
01:25:46,302 --> 01:25:48,262
I have no doubt of that.

1005
01:25:55,144 --> 01:25:57,021
Bring him before us, then.

1006
01:26:08,532 --> 01:26:09,950
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1007
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:11,577
Let him in.

1008
01:26:14,872 --> 01:26:18,792
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

1009
01:26:18,876 --> 01:26:20,753
Who is it?

1010
01:26:20,836 --> 01:26:24,590
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1011
01:26:24,673 --> 01:26:26,592
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1012
01:26:26,675 --> 01:26:31,597
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1013
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,351
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1014
01:26:36,477 --> 01:26:37,853
We will tell her for you.

1015
01:26:37,937 --> 01:26:40,022
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1016
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:42,149
Thank you, Your Highness.

1017
01:26:56,413 --> 01:27:00,334
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1018
01:27:07,633 --> 01:27:11,553
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

1019
01:27:11,804 --> 01:27:13,973
a tragedy has occurred

1020
01:27:14,056 --> 01:27:17,685
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes

1021
01:27:18,227 --> 01:27:20,980
and has now engulfed our entire planet

1022
01:27:21,063 --> 01:27:22,856
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1023
01:27:23,857 --> 01:27:25,442
This is outrageous!

1024
01:27:25,526 --> 01:27:27,861
I object to the senator's statements.

1025
01:27:27,945 --> 01:27:29,905
The chair does not
recognize the senator

1026
01:27:29,989 --> 01:27:32,032
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1027
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:36,036
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

1028
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,122
recently elected ruler of the Naboo,

1029
01:27:38,455 --> 01:27:40,374
who speaks on our behalf.

1030
01:27:46,422 --> 01:27:48,882
Honorable
representatives of the Republic,

1031
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,344
I come to you
under the gravest of circumstances.

1032
01:27:52,428 --> 01:27:55,639
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1033
01:27:55,723 --> 01:27:58,767
I object! There is no proof!

1034
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:01,020
This is incredible.

1035
01:28:01,103 --> 01:28:04,940
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1036
01:28:05,024 --> 01:28:06,942
The Congress of Malastare concurs

1037
01:28:07,026 --> 01:28:09,820
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1038
01:28:09,903 --> 01:28:12,948
- A commission must be appointed.
- The point...

1039
01:28:13,032 --> 01:28:15,951
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
- Enter the bureaucrat.

1040
01:28:16,035 --> 01:28:18,996
The true rulers of the Republic.

1041
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:22,916
And on the payroll of the
Trade Federation, I might add.

1042
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:27,588
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1043
01:28:29,131 --> 01:28:31,258
The point is conceded.

1044
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:34,136
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission

1045
01:28:34,219 --> 01:28:36,972
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1046
01:28:37,473 --> 01:28:38,891
I will not defer.

1047
01:28:38,974 --> 01:28:42,603
I've come before you to resolve this
attack on our sovereignty now.

1048
01:28:42,936 --> 01:28:46,106
I was not elected
to watch my people suffer and die

1049
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:48,484
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1050
01:28:51,612 --> 01:28:54,031
If this body is not capable of action,

1051
01:28:54,114 --> 01:28:56,909
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1052
01:28:59,161 --> 01:29:01,789
I move for a vote of no confidence

1053
01:29:01,872 --> 01:29:04,249
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1054
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,883
Vote now! Vote now!

1055
01:29:12,966 --> 01:29:15,844
Vote now! Vote now!

1056
01:29:16,053 --> 01:29:18,722
- Vote now! Vote now!
- Order!

1057
01:29:18,972 --> 01:29:21,683
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1058
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,894
a strong chancellor,

1059
01:29:23,977 --> 01:29:27,689
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1060
01:29:28,565 --> 01:29:32,903
The boy will not pass the
council's test, Master. He's too old.

1061
01:29:32,986 --> 01:29:35,948
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1062
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:38,742
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

1063
01:29:39,118 --> 01:29:41,495
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1064
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:47,126
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1065
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:50,629
They will not
go along with you this time.

1066
01:29:50,712 --> 01:29:53,632
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1067
01:29:56,927 --> 01:29:58,053
A ship.

1068
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,890
A cup.

1069
01:30:02,141 --> 01:30:03,517
A ship.

1070
01:30:04,893 --> 01:30:06,061
A speeder.

1071
01:30:10,065 --> 01:30:11,066
Hmm.

1072
01:30:14,111 --> 01:30:15,696
How feel you?

1073
01:30:16,488 --> 01:30:17,990
Cold, sir.

1074
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:20,993
Afraid are you?

1075
01:30:21,076 --> 01:30:22,995
No, sir.

1076
01:30:23,078 --> 01:30:25,581
See through you we can.

1077
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:27,749
Be mindful of your feelings.

1078
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:30,460
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1079
01:30:32,045 --> 01:30:34,381
I miss her.

1080
01:30:34,756 --> 01:30:37,009
Afraid to lose her, I think, hmm?

1081
01:30:37,259 --> 01:30:39,595
What has that got to do with anything?

1082
01:30:39,803 --> 01:30:41,889
Everything.

1083
01:30:41,972 --> 01:30:45,058
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1084
01:30:45,142 --> 01:30:47,978
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1085
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:51,648
Hate leads to suffering.

1086
01:30:58,071 --> 01:31:00,991
I sense much fear in you.

1087
01:31:14,546 --> 01:31:17,549
Yousa finking yousa people ganna die?

1088
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:19,343
I don't know.

1089
01:31:20,177 --> 01:31:22,512
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1090
01:31:24,765 --> 01:31:26,600
I hope not.

1091
01:31:27,017 --> 01:31:29,811
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

1092
01:31:29,895 --> 01:31:31,647
Wesa warriors.

1093
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:34,983
Wesa got a grand army.

1094
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:38,528
Dat's why you no liken us, mesa finks.

1095
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:40,530
Your Highness?

1096
01:31:42,282 --> 01:31:44,701
Your Highness.

1097
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:47,829
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum

1098
01:31:48,038 --> 01:31:49,206
as Supreme Chancellor.

1099
01:31:49,289 --> 01:31:53,293
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1100
01:31:53,377 --> 01:31:57,923
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1101
01:31:58,006 --> 01:31:59,508
Who else has been nominated?

1102
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:04,137
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1103
01:32:04,221 --> 01:32:09,184
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1104
01:32:10,894 --> 01:32:12,729
I will be chancellor.

1105
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:15,399
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator,

1106
01:32:15,732 --> 01:32:18,986
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1107
01:32:19,069 --> 01:32:20,988
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1108
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:24,366
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1109
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:30,497
Senator, this is your arena.

1110
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,249
I feel I must return to mine.

1111
01:32:35,836 --> 01:32:37,921
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1112
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:40,465
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1113
01:32:40,549 --> 01:32:42,009
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1114
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:44,636
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1115
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,681
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1116
01:32:47,764 --> 01:32:49,016
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1117
01:32:49,099 --> 01:32:50,392
Ready my ship.

1118
01:32:50,475 --> 01:32:55,063
Please, Your Majesty,
stay here where it's safe.

1119
01:32:55,147 --> 01:32:58,275
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

1120
01:32:59,067 --> 01:33:03,405
I pray you will bring sanity and
compassion back to the senate.

1121
01:33:13,206 --> 01:33:15,625
The Force is strong with him.

1122
01:33:15,709 --> 01:33:17,669
He is to be trained, then?

1123
01:33:19,338 --> 01:33:21,923
No, he will not be trained.

1124
01:33:22,174 --> 01:33:23,675
No?

1125
01:33:25,886 --> 01:33:27,804
He is too old.

1126
01:33:28,055 --> 01:33:31,350
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1127
01:33:31,433 --> 01:33:32,726
Hmm.

1128
01:33:32,893 --> 01:33:36,396
Clouded this boy's future is.

1129
01:33:39,316 --> 01:33:40,400
I will train him, then.

1130
01:33:44,988 --> 01:33:47,616
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1131
01:33:48,367 --> 01:33:50,911
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1132
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:53,121
Impossible to take on a second.

1133
01:33:53,288 --> 01:33:55,082
The code forbids it.

1134
01:33:55,457 --> 01:33:58,418
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1135
01:33:58,877 --> 01:34:02,172
Our own counsel
we will keep on who is ready.

1136
01:34:03,423 --> 01:34:04,549
He is headstrong,

1137
01:34:04,633 --> 01:34:07,594
and he has much to learn of the
living Force, but he is capable.

1138
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:09,805
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1139
01:34:12,307 --> 01:34:16,186
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1140
01:34:16,353 --> 01:34:18,980
Now is not the time for this.

1141
01:34:19,564 --> 01:34:22,109
The senate is voting
for a new Supreme Chancellor,

1142
01:34:22,192 --> 01:34:24,236
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1143
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:26,238
which will put pressure
on the Federation

1144
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:27,989
and could widen the confrontation.

1145
01:34:28,073 --> 01:34:30,283
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1146
01:34:30,617 --> 01:34:35,872
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1147
01:34:36,164 --> 01:34:40,210
This is the clue we need
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1148
01:34:40,877 --> 01:34:43,255
May the Force be with you.

1149
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,229
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1150
01:34:59,312 --> 01:35:00,939
From your point of view.

1151
01:35:01,022 --> 01:35:04,985
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1152
01:35:05,068 --> 01:35:07,988
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1153
01:35:08,071 --> 01:35:10,240
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1154
01:35:10,323 --> 01:35:14,077
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1155
01:35:19,082 --> 01:35:22,919
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1156
01:35:23,003 --> 01:35:25,255
You won't be, Ani.

1157
01:35:25,338 --> 01:35:27,090
I'm not allowed to train you,

1158
01:35:27,174 --> 01:35:29,384
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1159
01:35:29,843 --> 01:35:32,220
Always remember.

1160
01:35:32,304 --> 01:35:35,098
Your focus determines your reality.

1161
01:35:35,432 --> 01:35:38,727
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1162
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:40,353
Master, sir,

1163
01:35:40,645 --> 01:35:44,024
I heard Yoda
talking about midi-chlorians.

1164
01:35:44,107 --> 01:35:47,569
I've been wondering.
What are midi-chlorians?

1165
01:35:49,029 --> 01:35:51,198
Midi-chlorians
are a microscopic life-form

1166
01:35:51,281 --> 01:35:53,575
that resides within all living cells.

1167
01:35:55,243 --> 01:35:57,996
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1168
01:35:58,497 --> 01:36:01,791
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1169
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:05,504
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1170
01:36:05,587 --> 01:36:08,507
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist

1171
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:11,426
and we would have no knowledge
of the Force.

1172
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:13,428
They continually speak to us,

1173
01:36:13,512 --> 01:36:16,473
telling us the will of the Force.

1174
01:36:16,723 --> 01:36:18,683
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1175
01:36:18,767 --> 01:36:20,477
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1176
01:36:21,144 --> 01:36:22,479
I don't understand.

1177
01:36:23,104 --> 01:36:26,149
With time and training, Ani, you will.
You will.

1178
01:36:30,153 --> 01:36:34,491
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to
continue to serve and protect you.

1179
01:36:34,574 --> 01:36:36,201
I welcome your help.

1180
01:36:36,284 --> 01:36:40,330
Senator Palpatine fears that the
Federation means to destroy me.

1181
01:36:40,413 --> 01:36:43,041
I assure you I will not allow
that to happen.

1182
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:46,211
Wesa goin' ho-0-0-me!

1183
01:36:46,294 --> 01:36:48,171
Come on, R2.

1184
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:00,517
Is the planet secure?

1185
01:37:00,934 --> 01:37:04,646
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1186
01:37:04,729 --> 01:37:08,066
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1187
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:14,406
Good. I will see to it that
in the senate things stay as they are.

1188
01:37:14,489 --> 01:37:18,034
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1189
01:37:18,118 --> 01:37:19,828
Yes, my lord.

1190
01:37:19,911 --> 01:37:21,871
A Sith here?

1191
01:37:27,419 --> 01:37:29,671
Those are
the forward stabilizers.

1192
01:37:30,005 --> 01:37:32,424
And those two control the pitch?

1193
01:37:33,967 --> 01:37:35,635
You catch on pretty quick.

1194
01:37:35,969 --> 01:37:37,387
As soon as we land,

1195
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:40,473
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1196
01:37:40,557 --> 01:37:44,311
I agree. I'm not sure
what you wish to accomplish by this.

1197
01:37:44,561 --> 01:37:47,731
I will fake back what's ours.

1198
01:37:47,814 --> 01:37:50,025
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1199
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:52,027
We have no army.

1200
01:37:52,193 --> 01:37:55,530
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1201
01:37:56,531 --> 01:37:57,616
Jar Jar Binks.

1202
01:37:58,533 --> 01:38:00,785
Mesa, Your Highness?

1203
01:38:01,077 --> 01:38:04,539
Yes. I need your help.

1204
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:11,338
I have one battleship on my scope.

1205
01:38:11,755 --> 01:38:13,423
It's a droid control ship.

1206
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:15,842
They've probably spotted us.

1207
01:38:15,925 --> 01:38:17,469
We haven't much time.

1208
01:38:29,272 --> 01:38:32,108
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1209
01:38:32,192 --> 01:38:33,234
Good.

1210
01:38:33,318 --> 01:38:35,987
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1211
01:38:36,071 --> 01:38:37,489
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1212
01:38:39,699 --> 01:38:42,577
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1213
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:47,040
I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1214
01:38:47,123 --> 01:38:50,669
It's not my place
to disagree with you about the boy.

1215
01:38:52,837 --> 01:38:55,882
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1216
01:38:57,217 --> 01:38:59,511
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1217
01:39:00,553 --> 01:39:03,640
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1218
01:39:03,723 --> 01:39:07,060
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1219
01:39:20,281 --> 01:39:22,450
Desa nobody dare.

1220
01:39:22,617 --> 01:39:24,744
The Gungan city is deserted.

1221
01:39:25,078 --> 01:39:27,664
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1222
01:39:27,747 --> 01:39:30,625
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1223
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:33,336
More likely they were wiped out.

1224
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:36,423
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1225
01:39:36,589 --> 01:39:39,801
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1226
01:39:40,135 --> 01:39:43,471
Mesa show you. Come on.
Mesa show you!

1227
01:40:01,239 --> 01:40:05,702
Your Honor,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1228
01:40:10,457 --> 01:40:14,753
Heyo dadee,
Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1229
01:40:15,712 --> 01:40:17,964
Jar Jar Binks.

1230
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:22,260
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1231
01:40:22,594 --> 01:40:24,763
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1232
01:40:25,764 --> 01:40:28,016
I come before you in peace.

1233
01:40:29,225 --> 01:40:30,769
Naboo biggen.

1234
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:34,230
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1235
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:38,026
Yousa all bombad.

1236
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,780
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1237
01:40:41,863 --> 01:40:43,782
Your Honor.

1238
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:48,411
Whosa dis?

1239
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,372
- Am Queen Amidala.
- Huh?

1240
01:40:52,332 --> 01:40:54,042
This is my decoy,

1241
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:57,629
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1242
01:40:58,129 --> 01:41:02,050
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1243
01:41:02,634 --> 01:41:04,719
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honor,

1244
01:41:04,844 --> 01:41:07,514
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1245
01:41:07,597 --> 01:41:08,681
Ah...

1246
01:41:08,765 --> 01:41:09,849
The Trade Federation

1247
01:41:09,933 --> 01:41:12,435
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1248
01:41:12,769 --> 01:41:15,772
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1249
01:41:15,855 --> 01:41:18,358
I ask you to help us.

1250
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:20,985
No, I beg you to help us.

1251
01:41:21,277 --> 01:41:23,446
We are your humble servants.

1252
01:41:26,825 --> 01:41:29,577
Our fate is in your hands.

1253
01:41:30,203 --> 01:41:31,538
Hmm.

1254
01:41:46,678 --> 01:41:50,932
Yousa no tinken
yousa greater den da Gungans?

1255
01:41:53,685 --> 01:41:57,355
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1256
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:01,901
Maybe wesa

1257
01:42:02,235 --> 01:42:04,153
bein friends.

1258
01:42:12,787 --> 01:42:14,539
We've sent our patrols.

1259
01:42:15,331 --> 01:42:18,251
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1260
01:42:18,334 --> 01:42:20,336
It won't be long, my lord.

1261
01:42:20,795 --> 01:42:23,798
This is an unexpected move for her.

1262
01:42:23,882 --> 01:42:25,675
It's too aggressive.

1263
01:42:25,758 --> 01:42:28,303
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1264
01:42:28,845 --> 01:42:30,889
Let them make the first move.

1265
01:42:30,972 --> 01:42:33,558
Yes, my master.

1266
01:42:36,644 --> 01:42:38,146
Deysa comin!

1267
01:42:38,438 --> 01:42:40,148
All right!

1268
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:44,611
They're here!

1269
01:42:45,069 --> 01:42:46,404
Good. They made it.

1270
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,786
Yousa doen grand.

1271
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:57,373
Jar Jar bring
uss-en and da Naboo together.

1272
01:42:57,457 --> 01:42:59,167
No, no, no.

1273
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:01,920
So, wesa make you

1274
01:43:02,003 --> 01:43:04,756
bombad general.

1275
01:43:04,839 --> 01:43:06,257
General?

1276
01:43:09,052 --> 01:43:10,637
Captain.

1277
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,514
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1278
01:43:13,598 --> 01:43:15,266
Almost everyone's in camps.

1279
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:17,018
A few hundred police and guards

1280
01:43:17,101 --> 01:43:18,728
have formed an underground
resistance movement.

1281
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:21,397
I brought back
as many of the leaders as I could.

1282
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:26,110
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1283
01:43:27,612 --> 01:43:30,698
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1284
01:43:30,907 --> 01:43:32,909
The battle is a diversion.

1285
01:43:32,992 --> 01:43:35,870
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1286
01:43:36,245 --> 01:43:37,956
R2.

1287
01:43:38,414 --> 01:43:42,502
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1288
01:43:42,585 --> 01:43:44,087
Once we get to the main entrance,

1289
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:47,215
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1290
01:43:47,298 --> 01:43:50,301
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1291
01:43:50,802 --> 01:43:54,180
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1292
01:43:54,263 --> 01:43:55,765
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1293
01:43:55,932 --> 01:43:57,850
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1294
01:43:58,059 --> 01:44:00,603
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1295
01:44:00,687 --> 01:44:02,897
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1296
01:44:03,314 --> 01:44:07,735
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1297
01:44:07,902 --> 01:44:11,114
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1298
01:44:11,197 --> 01:44:14,534
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1299
01:44:14,784 --> 01:44:16,452
We will send what pilots we have

1300
01:44:16,536 --> 01:44:19,706
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1301
01:44:19,914 --> 01:44:22,792
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1302
01:44:22,959 --> 01:44:25,795
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1303
01:44:25,878 --> 01:44:27,797
There's an even bigger danger.

1304
01:44:27,964 --> 01:44:29,882
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1305
01:44:29,966 --> 01:44:32,260
he will return with another droid army.

1306
01:44:32,552 --> 01:44:35,805
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1307
01:44:35,888 --> 01:44:38,599
Everything depends on it.

1308
01:44:42,979 --> 01:44:45,690
She is more foolish than I thought.

1309
01:44:45,898 --> 01:44:47,483
We are sending all troops

1310
01:44:47,567 --> 01:44:50,737
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1311
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:53,364
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1312
01:44:53,948 --> 01:44:55,992
This will work to our advantage.

1313
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:58,953
I have your approval to proceed,
then, my lord?

1314
01:45:00,038 --> 01:45:02,040
Wipe them out.

1315
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:05,376
All of them.

1316
01:45:36,115 --> 01:45:38,034
Halt!

1317
01:45:40,995 --> 01:45:43,039
Starting up the shield.

1318
01:46:12,735 --> 01:46:13,861
Open fire.

1319
01:46:29,919 --> 01:46:33,172
Once we get inside, you find a
safe place to hide and stay there.

1320
01:46:33,256 --> 01:46:35,174
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1321
01:46:51,649 --> 01:46:53,109
Roger. Roger.

1322
01:47:01,826 --> 01:47:04,328
I thought the battle
was going to take place far from here.

1323
01:47:05,288 --> 01:47:06,998
This is too close.

1324
01:47:13,004 --> 01:47:14,547
Ani, find cover.

1325
01:47:15,464 --> 01:47:17,758
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1326
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,819
- Fighters straight ahead.
- Roger, Bravo Leader.

1327
01:48:19,028 --> 01:48:20,071
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1328
01:48:28,788 --> 01:48:29,830
Cease fire.

1329
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:40,383
Steady. Steady.

1330
01:49:13,249 --> 01:49:16,210
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1331
01:49:33,019 --> 01:49:34,603
Ouch time.

1332
01:49:48,909 --> 01:49:49,910
Fire!

1333
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,143
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1334
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:17,396
Red group! Blue group!
Everybody, this way!

1335
01:50:18,189 --> 01:50:19,690
Hey, wait for me!

1336
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:22,276
Stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1337
01:50:22,443 --> 01:50:24,904
- But ..
- Stay in that cockpit.

1338
01:50:36,374 --> 01:50:39,627
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1339
01:51:00,064 --> 01:51:01,816
We gotta do something, R2.

1340
01:51:24,547 --> 01:51:27,550
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1341
01:51:31,137 --> 01:51:34,140
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1342
01:51:34,974 --> 01:51:37,518
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1343
01:51:39,687 --> 01:51:40,688
Yeah!

1344
01:51:46,193 --> 01:51:48,070
Let's go!

1345
01:51:49,113 --> 01:51:50,906
It's on automatic pilot.

1346
01:52:00,207 --> 01:52:01,667
Try to override it.

1347
01:53:01,894 --> 01:53:03,896
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1348
01:53:10,236 --> 01:53:11,862
Look! There they are.

1349
01:53:11,946 --> 01:53:14,323
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1350
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:33,968
Dumb droid. Take that!

1351
01:53:34,051 --> 01:53:37,304
Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off!

1352
01:53:47,606 --> 01:53:49,733
The deflector shield is too strong.

1353
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:00,452
This is tense!

1354
01:54:02,037 --> 01:54:05,249
Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot.

1355
01:54:05,332 --> 01:54:07,001
It's gonna get us both killed.

1356
01:54:09,169 --> 01:54:11,297
You did it, R2!

1357
01:54:11,463 --> 01:54:12,548
Okay, let's go left.

1358
01:54:17,761 --> 01:54:18,846
Go back?

1359
01:54:19,138 --> 01:54:23,267
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1360
01:54:30,316 --> 01:54:32,526
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1361
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,701
I know we're in trouble. Just hang on.

1362
01:54:47,499 --> 01:54:48,542
Go!

1363
01:54:53,881 --> 01:54:55,215
Ascension guns!

1364
01:57:01,383 --> 01:57:02,801
Retreat! Retreat!

1365
01:57:04,887 --> 01:57:06,680
Dis is nutsen.

1366
01:57:16,899 --> 01:57:18,484
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1367
01:57:26,241 --> 01:57:27,493
Uh-oh.

1368
01:57:36,668 --> 01:57:39,046
Hey! Hey!

1369
01:57:39,421 --> 01:57:40,964
Give me a lift!

1370
01:57:48,806 --> 01:57:50,516
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1371
01:57:50,682 --> 01:57:52,434
What? Mesa no have a booma!

1372
01:57:52,851 --> 01:57:54,520
Here. Taken dis one.

1373
01:58:08,242 --> 01:58:09,618
Help me!

1374
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:14,248
Jar Jar! Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1375
01:58:24,424 --> 01:58:27,010
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1376
01:58:40,065 --> 01:58:41,525
We're hit, R2!

1377
01:58:55,455 --> 01:58:58,542
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1378
01:59:05,674 --> 01:59:07,009
Everything's overheated.

1379
01:59:08,635 --> 01:59:10,554
Oops. This is not good.

1380
01:59:56,224 --> 01:59:57,893
No!

1381
02:00:22,918 --> 02:00:25,337
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1382
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:27,297
Mesa tink of something.

1383
02:00:27,714 --> 02:00:29,800
- Hands up.
- My give up.

1384
02:00:29,883 --> 02:00:31,593
My give up.

1385
02:00:40,519 --> 02:00:43,522
Your little insurrection is at an end,
Your Highness.

1386
02:00:43,605 --> 02:00:47,693
Time for you to sign the treaty and
end this pointless debate in the senate.

1387
02:00:47,776 --> 02:00:49,361
Viceroy!

1388
02:00:49,528 --> 02:00:51,530
Your occupation here has ended.

1389
02:00:53,073 --> 02:00:56,535
After her. This one's a decoy.

1390
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:04,543
Captain!

1391
02:01:13,802 --> 02:01:15,679
Jam the doors.

1392
02:01:19,141 --> 02:01:21,893
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1393
02:02:25,373 --> 02:02:26,708
Yes! We have power.

1394
02:02:26,875 --> 02:02:27,876
Shields up.

1395
02:02:30,921 --> 02:02:32,839
Take this!

1396
02:02:34,257 --> 02:02:35,383
And this!

1397
02:02:37,094 --> 02:02:38,261
Whoa.

1398
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,060
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1399
02:02:45,143 --> 02:02:46,895
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1400
02:02:46,978 --> 02:02:48,605
Impossible!

1401
02:02:48,688 --> 02:02:50,440
Nothing can get through our shield.

1402
02:02:51,566 --> 02:02:52,609
Let's get outta here.

1403
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:04,162
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1404
02:03:07,707 --> 02:03:08,834
We didn't hit it.

1405
02:03:12,045 --> 02:03:13,880
Now, this is Podracing.

1406
02:03:15,674 --> 02:03:17,175
Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!

1407
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:19,261
Whoo!

1408
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:24,641
Whoo!

1409
02:03:24,724 --> 02:03:25,976
Yeah!

1410
02:03:38,655 --> 02:03:40,031
What the...

1411
02:03:40,699 --> 02:03:42,492
Was'n they doing?

1412
02:03:42,742 --> 02:03:46,079
The control ship has been destroyed.
Look!

1413
02:03:48,039 --> 02:03:50,167
They all broke-ed.

1414
02:04:38,798 --> 02:04:41,968
No, it's too late.

1415
02:04:42,052 --> 02:04:44,679
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1416
02:04:45,889 --> 02:04:47,807
Promise...

1417
02:04:47,891 --> 02:04:50,143
Promise me you will train the boy.

1418
02:04:50,477 --> 02:04:51,853
Yes, Master.

1419
02:04:56,024 --> 02:04:58,818
He is the chosen one.

1420
02:04:58,902 --> 02:05:02,197
He will bring balance.

1421
02:05:03,281 --> 02:05:05,200
Train him.

1422
02:05:32,269 --> 02:05:33,979
Now, Viceroy,

1423
02:05:34,187 --> 02:05:37,399
you're going to have to go back to
the senate and explain all this.

1424
02:05:39,234 --> 02:05:42,529
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1425
02:05:56,167 --> 02:05:59,963
We are indebted to you for your
bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1426
02:06:00,046 --> 02:06:01,756
And you, young Skywalker.

1427
02:06:02,465 --> 02:06:05,885
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1428
02:06:12,267 --> 02:06:15,061
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1429
02:06:15,603 --> 02:06:18,189
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1430
02:06:18,273 --> 02:06:20,150
It's you who should be congratulated.

1431
02:06:20,233 --> 02:06:24,738
Together we shall bring
peace and prosperity to the Republic.

1432
02:06:29,951 --> 02:06:34,414
Confer on you the level of Jedi knight
the council does.

1433
02:06:34,789 --> 02:06:39,336
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1434
02:06:39,419 --> 02:06:41,338
I do not.

1435
02:06:41,421 --> 02:06:43,465
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1436
02:06:46,343 --> 02:06:49,095
The chosen one the boy may be.

1437
02:06:49,179 --> 02:06:50,805
Nevertheless,

1438
02:06:50,889 --> 02:06:53,808
grave danger I fear in his training.

1439
02:06:54,309 --> 02:06:58,313
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1440
02:06:58,396 --> 02:07:00,440
I will train Anakin.

1441
02:07:02,359 --> 02:07:04,736
Without the approval of the council,
if I must.

1442
02:07:04,819 --> 02:07:07,238
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1443
02:07:07,322 --> 02:07:09,908
Need that you do not.

1444
02:07:11,868 --> 02:07:14,245
Agree with you the council does.

1445
02:07:16,206 --> 02:07:19,292
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1446
02:07:47,070 --> 02:07:48,947
What will happen to me now?

1447
02:07:49,197 --> 02:07:52,325
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1448
02:07:52,409 --> 02:07:55,537
You will be a Jed, I promise.

1449
02:08:04,963 --> 02:08:07,424
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1450
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:11,219
Always two there are.

1451
02:08:11,302 --> 02:08:14,180
No more, no less.

1452
02:08:14,264 --> 02:08:17,308
A master and an apprentice.

1453
02:08:17,392 --> 02:08:19,310
But which was destroyed?

1454
02:08:19,394 --> 02:08:21,980
The master or the apprentice?

1455
02:08:47,213 --> 02:08:48,882
Hello, everybody!

1456
02:09:35,595 --> 02:09:37,347
Peace!
