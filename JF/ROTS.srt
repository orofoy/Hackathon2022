1
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:08,911
Lock on to them, R2.

2
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,551
Master,

3
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,412
General Grievous's ship
is directly ahead...

4
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,621
the one crawling with vulture droids.

5
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:15,818
Oh, I see it.

6
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,216
Oh, this is going be easy.

7
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
<b><font color="#ffd200">Resync by:- </font><font color="#ff0000">Kapila R Jayasooriya</font></b>
<i><font color="#e829ff">Enjoy!</font></i>

8
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:26,777
Oddball, do you copy?

9
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:27,880
<i>Copy, Red Leader.</i>

10
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:28,704
Mark my position.

11
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,217
Form your squad up behind me.

12
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:31,889
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

13
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:33,840
Set S-foils in attack position.

14
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:49,904
This is where the fun begins.

15
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,487
Let's them pass between us.

16
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:10,448
They're all over me.

17
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:12,633
<i>Get them off my...</i>

18
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:14,227
I'm gonna go help them out.

19
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,061
<i>No!</i>

20
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:15,480
No.

21
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,602
They are doing their job

22
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,521
<i>so we can do ours.</i>

23
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,903
Missiles! Pull up!

24
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,082
They overshot us!

25
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,410
They're coming around.

26
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:45,477
Alright, R4.

27
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,506
No, no, no, no.

28
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,808
No, nothing to fancy.

29
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,905
Search all power units, R2.

30
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,210
Stand by, reverse thrusters.

31
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,220
We got em, R2.

32
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,372
Flying is for droids.

33
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,747
I'm hit!
Anakin?

34
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,773
<i>I see them.</i>

35
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:27,934
Buzz droids.

36
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,247
R4, be careful!
You have a...

37
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:42,423
Oh, dear.

38
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,287
They're shutting down all the controls.

39
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,547
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

40
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:49,833
<i>The mission!</i>

41
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,237
Get to the command ship.
Get the Chancellor.

42
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:53,823
<i>I'm running out of tricks here.</i>

43
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,733
In the name of...

44
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,225
Hold your fire!
You're not helping here!

45
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:06,777
I agree. Bad idea.

46
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:14,834
I can't see a thing.

47
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,103
<i>My cockpit's fogging.</i>

48
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,687
They're all over me!

49
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:21,218
<i>Anakin!</i>

50
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,974
Move to the right.

51
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:27,047
Hold on, Anakin!

52
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:28,234
Your gonna get us both killed!

53
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,542
Get out of here!
There nothing more you can do!

54
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:34,495
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

55
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:47,672
Get him, R2!

56
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:50,801
Watch out.

57
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,916
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

58
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:05,357
Yeah! You got him!

59
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:06,526
Great, R2!

60
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,866
The general's command
ship is dead ahead.

61
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,912
Well, have you noticed
the shields are still up?

62
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:16,420
Sorry, Master!

63
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,524
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

64
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:43,270
There they are!
Get them!

65
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:55,992
R2!

66
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,428
Locate the Chancellor!

67
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:08,111
The Chancellor's signal
is coming from right there.

68
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,819
The observation platform
at the top of that spire.

69
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:13,177
I sense Count Dooku.

70
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,146
I sense a trap.

71
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,134
Next move?

72
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:17,991
Spring the trap.

73
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:22,655
R2, go back.

74
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:23,995
I need you to stay with the ship.

75
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,746
Here. Take this.
Wait for orders.

76
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,457
What's the situation...

77
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:43,582
Captain?

78
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,170
Two Jedi have landed,

79
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,370
in main hangar bay.

80
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:47,512
We're tracking them.

81
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,909
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

82
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,083
Destroyers!

83
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,279
Drop your weapons.

84
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:08,559
I said drop them.

85
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,325
Roger, roger, roger, roger, roger.

86
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,185
Those are Jedi fighters alright.

87
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,472
Did you press the stop button?

88
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:28,481
No. Did you?
No.

89
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,844
Well, there is more than
one way out of here.

90
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,809
We don't want to get out.

91
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,174
We want to get moving. R2.

92
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,526
Activate elevator...

93
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,456
<i>31174.</i>

94
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:40,003
<i>Come on, R2!</i>

95
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:40,755
What's that?

96
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,431
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

97
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:44,825
<i>R2, activate the elevator number.</i>

98
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,602
<i>31174.</i>

99
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:48,666
Get back to work.

100
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:50,237
That nothing.

101
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:53,167
<i>Activate the elevator. 31174.</i>

102
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:54,248
R2, We...

103
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,040
Always on the move.

104
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,687
<i>R2, switch on the comlink.</i>

105
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,088
<i>R2, can you hear me?</i>

106
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,277
R2!

107
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,458
<i>R2! R2!</i>

108
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:18,428
Stop! Stop!

109
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,133
R2, we need to be going up.

110
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,102
Hands up, Jedi.

111
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:25,966
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

112
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,003
<i>R2, do you hear me?</i>

113
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:29,566
<i>R2, we need to be going up.</i>

114
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:30,597
<i>Not down.</i>

115
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,104
Hey, you!

116
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:43,287
Now, that's better.

117
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,598
You stupid little astro droid.

118
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,257
Oh, It's you.

119
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,245
My eyes!
My eyes!

120
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:05,901
What was that all about?

121
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:07,295
Well, R2 has been...

122
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,026
No loose wire jokes.

123
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:10,628
Did I say anything?
He's trying.

124
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:11,719
I didn't say anything.

125
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:50,447
Chancellor.

126
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,212
Are you alright?

127
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,805
Count Dooku.

128
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,483
This time we'll do it together.

129
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,329
I was about to say that.

130
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,430
Get help. You're no match for him.

131
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:13,512
He's a Sith lord.

132
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:15,737
Chancellor Palpatine.

133
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:18,021
Sith lords are our speciality.

134
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,828
Your swords, please.

135
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,932
We don't want to make
a mess of things,

136
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,315
in front of the Chancellor.

137
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:26,792
You don't get away this time, Dooku.

138
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,129
I been looking forward to this.

139
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,831
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

140
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,008
Good.

141
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:46,359
Twice the pride, double the fall.

142
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:07,884
Get!

143
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,639
I sense great...

144
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,852
fear you, Skywalker.

145
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:39,101
You have hate.

146
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:40,883
You have anger.

147
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:43,220
But you don't use them.

148
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:04,871
Good, Anakin!

149
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:05,763
Good!

150
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:09,103
Kill him.

151
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,072
Kill him now.

152
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:19,431
I shouldn't.

153
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:23,665
Do it!

154
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:38,127
You did well, Anakin.

155
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:42,189
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

156
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,393
Yes, but he was a unarmed prisoner.

157
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,934
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

158
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,707
It is only natural.

159
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,222
He cut off your arm.

160
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,893
You wanted revenge.

161
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,777
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

162
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,584
Remember you told me
about your mother...

163
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,287
and the sand people.

164
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:04,667
Now we must leave,

165
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,579
before more security droids arrive.

166
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:12,649
Anakin.

167
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,502
There's no time.

168
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,449
We must get off the ship
before it's too late.

169
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:19,861
He seems to be alright.

170
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:21,649
Leave him or we'll never make it.

171
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:23,690
His fate will be the same as ours.

172
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,894
Prepare for attack!

173
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:34,363
All batteries!

174
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,462
Fire, fire!

175
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,434
Elevator's not working.

176
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:52,779
R2, activate elevator.

177
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:53,825
3224.

178
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,177
Reverse stabilizers.

179
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,672
Reversing stabilizers.

180
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:37,126
Magnetize! Magnetize!

181
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,793
Fire the emergency booster engines!

182
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:53,934
We're leveling out, sir.

183
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,507
Easy!

184
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,781
We're in a bit of situation.

185
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:13,432
Did I miss something?

186
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,658
Hold on.

187
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:15,690
What is that?

188
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,932
R2. R2. Shut down the elevator.

189
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,244
Too late! Jump!

190
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:36,446
Let's see if we can find something

191
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,281
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

192
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:40,017
R2, get down here.

193
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,293
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

194
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:49,816
General, we found the Jedi.

195
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,340
They're in hallway 328.

196
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:53,899
Activate ray shields.

197
00:17:57,104 --> 00:17:58,169
Ray shields.

198
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,051
Wait a minute.

199
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,051
How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

200
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:02,715
Apparently not.

201
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:05,994
I say patience.

202
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:07,605
Patience.

203
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,683
Yes.

204
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,886
R2 we'll be out in a fewmoments
and then...

205
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,025
He'll release the ray shields.

206
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,342
See? No problem.

207
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,232
Don't move.

208
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,637
Do you have a plan B?

209
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,535
Yes.

210
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:44,090
The negotiator.

211
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,914
General Kenobi.

212
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,237
We been waiting for you.

213
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:49,630
Excuse me.

214
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:52,178
That wasn't much a rescue.

215
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:53,402
Your welcome.

216
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,551
And...

217
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,368
Anakin Skywalker.

218
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:02,849
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little...

219
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:05,193
older.

220
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,454
General Grievous.

221
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,919
Your shorter than I expected.

222
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,269
Jedi scum.

223
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:16,820
We have a job to do, Anakin.

224
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,091
Try not to upset him.

225
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,552
Your lightsabers will make a fine
addition to my collection.

226
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:29,505
Not this time.

227
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,672
And this time, you won't escape.

228
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:32,698
R2!

229
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,217
Crush them!

230
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,475
Make them suffer!

231
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:48,238
Come! Now!

232
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:50,838
Stay at your stations!

233
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,688
Get him! Get him!

234
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
Run!

235
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,412
Don't bother with them.

236
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:27,658
Keep the ship in orbit.
Yes, sir.

237
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:39,956
You lose,

238
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:41,432
General Kenobi.

239
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,818
Get out of here! Run!

240
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,874
Time to abandon ship.

241
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,394
All the escape pods
have been launched.

242
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,523
Grievous.

243
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:35,575
Can you fly a cruiser like this?

244
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:37,314
You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing?

245
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,339
Well.

246
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:39,856
Well, under the circumstances,

247
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:41,869
I'd say the ability to pilot
this thing is irrelevant.

248
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:43,210
Strap yourselves in.

249
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:48,056
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

250
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:06,592
We lost something.

251
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:07,962
Not to worry.

252
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:09,619
We are still flying half a ship.

253
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,884
Now, we're really picking up speed.

254
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:27,275
8 plus 60.

255
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:29,236
We're in the atmosphere.

256
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,572
Grab that. Keep us level.

257
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,236
Steady.

258
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,205
Easy, R2!

259
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:55,088
5000.

260
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:57,494
Fire ships on the left and the right.

261
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:58,580
<i>We'll take you in.</i>

262
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,063
<i>Copy that.</i>

263
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,079
Landing strip, straight ahead.

264
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:06,056
We're coming in too hot.

265
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:38,960
Another happy landing.

266
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,185
Are you coming, Master?

267
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:14,207
Oh, no.
I'm not brave enough for politics.

268
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:15,619
I have to report to the council.

269
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:18,130
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

270
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,273
Hold on.

271
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,816
This whole operation was your idea.

272
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:23,526
Let us not forget, Anakin,

273
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:25,596
that you rescued me
from the buzz droids.

274
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:26,902
And you killed Count Dooku,

275
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,277
and you rescued the Chancellor.

276
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,865
Carry me unconscious on your back.

277
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,278
All because of your training.

278
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:34,144
Anakin.

279
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:36,135
Let's be fair.
Today you were the hero.

280
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,357
And you deserve your glorious
day with the politicians.

281
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:41,582
Alright. But you owe me one.

282
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:43,675
And not for saving your
skin for the 10th time.

283
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,977
9th time.

284
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:47,613
That business
on Cato Neimoidia doesn't...

285
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:48,596
doesn't count.

286
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:49,793
I'll see you in briefing.

287
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,550
Chancellor Palpatine.

288
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:57,809
Are you alright?

289
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,121
Yes.

290
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,752
Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

291
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:02,012
They killed Count Dooku.

292
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,160
But, General Grievous
has escaped once again.

293
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,193
General Grievous will run and hide,

294
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:08,442
as he always does.

295
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:09,254
He's a coward.

296
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,942
But with Count Dooku dead,

297
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,953
he is the leader of the droid army.

298
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,180
And I assure you,

299
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:17,399
the senate will vote
to continue the war

300
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:19,253
as long as Grievous is alive.

301
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,242
Then the Jedi Council will make

302
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:23,457
finding Grievous our highest priority.

303
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,723
Watch it.
Excuse me.

304
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:28,112
Come along, R2.

305
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:30,035
The Republic cannot praise
you enough.

306
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,622
Thank you, Sentor Organa.

307
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:35,755
Well, it couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

308
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,574
Now there I agree with you.

309
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,972
In fact, I could do
with a tune-up myself.

310
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:44,062
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is...

311
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:45,734
spare parts.

312
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,310
Well, I will do everything...

313
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,371
I can in the senate.

314
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:51,496
Excuse me.
Certainly.

315
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,950
Oh, Anakin.

316
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:08,867
I've missed you, Padmé.

317
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:11,723
There were whispers...

318
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:13,482
that you'd been killed.

319
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:14,552
I'm alright.

320
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:18,711
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

321
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:22,070
And it might have been if the Chancellor
hadn't been kidnapped.

322
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:24,075
I don't think they would
have ever brought us back,

323
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,253
from the outer rim sieges.

324
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,617
Wait. Not here.
Yes, here.

325
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,206
I'm tired of all this deception.

326
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:31,958
I don't care if they know
we're married.

327
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:33,982
Anakin, don't say things like that.

328
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,147
Are you alright?

329
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,606
You're trembling.

330
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:48,543
What's going on?

331
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,685
Something wonderful has happened.

332
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:55,862
Ani.

333
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:57,927
I'm pregnant.

334
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:03,593
That's...

335
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,969
Well, that's...
That's wonderful.

336
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:15,725
What are we gonna do?

337
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:20,303
We're not gonna worry
about anything right now.

338
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:21,757
Alright?

339
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:24,034
This is a happy moment.

340
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:28,038
A happiest moment of my life.

341
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:37,359
Yes, Lord Sidious.

342
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:39,267
<i>General Grievous.</i>

343
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:44,523
<i>I suggest you move the
separatist leaders to Mustafar.</i>

344
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:47,882
It will be done, my lord.

345
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:52,392
<i>The end of the war is near, General.</i>

346
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:56,561
But the loss of Count Dooku.

347
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:59,027
<i>His death was...</i>

348
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,805
<i>a necessary loss.</i>

349
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:04,870
<i>Soon I will have a new apprentice...</i>

350
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:07,932
<i>one far younger...</i>

351
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,684
<i>and more powerful.</i>

352
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,304
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

353
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,866
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know,

354
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:45,445
or we can be safe.

355
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,784
I can go early and fix up
the baby's room.

356
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,421
I know the perfect spot.

357
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,695
Right by the gardens.

358
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:03,553
You're so...

359
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:05,421
beautiful.

360
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,205
It's only because I'm so in love.

361
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:11,798
No.

362
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:14,079
No, It's because
I'm so in love with you.

363
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,509
So love has blinded you?

364
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:22,223
Well, that's not extactly what I meant.

365
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,827
That's probably true.

366
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:37,364
Anakin! Help me!

367
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:42,132
What's bothering you?

368
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:47,093
Nothing.

369
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,218
I remember when I gave this to you.

370
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,923
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

371
00:31:58,662 --> 00:31:59,725
It was a dream.

372
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:01,671
Bad?

373
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:04,481
Like the ones I used
to have about my mother.

374
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,367
Just before she died.

375
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:08,373
And?

376
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,388
And, it was about you.

377
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,568
Tell me.

378
00:32:20,943 --> 00:32:22,222
It was only a dream.

379
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,639
You died in childbirth.

380
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:38,835
And the baby.

381
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:41,921
I don't know.

382
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:45,852
It was only a dream.

383
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,823
I won't let this one become real.

384
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:51,349
This baby will change our lives.

385
00:32:52,815 --> 00:32:55,257
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

386
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,751
And if the council discovers
you're the father,

387
00:32:57,752 --> 00:32:59,194
you'll be expelled...
I know, I know.

388
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:02,336
Do you think,

389
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:04,279
Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

390
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:07,725
We don't need his help.

391
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,140
Our baby...

392
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:12,711
is a blessing.

393
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,452
Premonitions?

394
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,450
Premonitions.

395
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:35,396
These visions you have.

396
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,485
They're of pain...

397
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:40,132
suffering.

398
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:43,428
Death.

399
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,045
Yourself you speak of,

400
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,935
or someone you know?

401
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,366
Someone.

402
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:53,967
Close to you?

403
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,179
Yes.

404
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,408
Careful you must be,

405
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,429
when sensing the future, Anakin.

406
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,309
The fear of loss...

407
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,473
is a path to the dark side.

408
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:10,522
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

409
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,099
Death is a natural part of life.

410
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:16,999
Rejoice for those around you,

411
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,142
who transform into the Force.

412
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,090
Mourn them, do not.

413
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:22,757
Miss them, do not.

414
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:25,599
Attachment leads to jealousy.

415
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,122
The shadow of greed, that is.

416
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,882
What must I do, Master Yoda?

417
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:35,288
Train yourself to let go,

418
00:34:35,765 --> 00:34:38,807
of everything you fear to lose.

419
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:52,240
You've missed the
report on the outer rim sieges.

420
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:55,075
I'm sorry, I was held up.

421
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,383
I have no excuse.

422
00:34:57,608 --> 00:34:58,608
In short.

423
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:00,233
They are going very well.

424
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,797
Saleucami has fallen,

425
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:05,102
and Master Vos has moved
his troops to Boz Pity.

426
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:07,200
What's wrong, then?

427
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,191
The senate is expected
to vote more executive powers,

428
00:35:12,216 --> 00:35:13,538
to the Chancellor today.

429
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,883
Well, that can only mean less
deliberating and more action.

430
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:17,991
Is that bad?

431
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:20,554
It'll make it easier for us
to end this war.

432
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:24,474
Be cafeful for you friend, Palpatine.

433
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,075
Be careful of what?

434
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,940
He has requested your presence.

435
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:31,229
What for?

436
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,275
He would not say.

437
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:35,151
He didn't inform the council?

438
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:37,169
That's unusual, isn't it?

439
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,633
All of this is unusual.

440
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:41,492
And it's making me feel uneasy.

441
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:59,071
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

442
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:00,976
Of course.

443
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:03,998
I need your help, son.

444
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:06,273
What do you mean?

445
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:09,851
I'm depending on you.

446
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,366
For what?
I don't understand.

447
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:14,401
To be the eyes,

448
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,789
ears and voice,

449
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,957
of the Republic.

450
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:19,936
Anakin.

451
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,603
I'm appointing you to be my personal

452
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:24,788
representative on the Jedi Council.

453
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:26,265
Me?

454
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:27,928
A master?

455
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:31,716
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

456
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,400
But the council elects
its own members.

457
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:36,590
They'll never accept this.

458
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:38,049
I think they will.

459
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:39,892
They need you.

460
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:42,595
More than you know.

461
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,812
Allow this appointment lightly.

462
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:58,121
The council does not.

463
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,744
Disturbing is this move,
by Chancellor Palpatine.

464
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:04,314
I understand.

465
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:06,236
Your on this council.

466
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:09,266
But we do not grant you
the rank of master.

467
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:11,845
What?

468
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:18,702
How can you do this?

469
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,226
This is outrageous.

470
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,259
It's unfair.

471
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:25,512
How can you be on the council,

472
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:26,977
and not be a master?

473
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:28,916
Take a seat...

474
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,313
Young Skywalker.

475
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,101
Forgive me, Master.

476
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:41,882
<i>We have surveyed all systems,</i>

477
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,067
<i>in the Republic,</i>

478
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,705
<i>but have found no sign
of General Grievous.</i>

479
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:47,834
Hiding in the outer rim,

480
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,951
Grievous is.

481
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,984
The outlying systems you must sweep.

482
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:54,469
We do not have many ships to spare.

483
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,724
<i>What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?</i>

484
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:00,539
It is critical we send an attack group
there immediately.

485
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:01,644
He's right.

486
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:03,769
It's a system we cannot afford to lose.

487
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:06,695
Go, I will.

488
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:10,217
Good relations with the Wookiees,
I have.

489
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,291
It's settled in.

490
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,824
Yoda will take a battalion of clones,

491
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,061
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

492
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,392
May the Force be with us all.

493
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,899
What kind of nonsense this is?

494
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,782
Put me on the council and
not make me a master?

495
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,233
It's never been done in
the history of the Jedi.

496
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:30,151
It's insulting.

497
00:38:30,152 --> 00:38:30,999
Calm down, Anakin.

498
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,701
You have been given a great honor.

499
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,592
To be on the council at your age,

500
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:36,080
it's never happened before.

501
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:40,231
The fact of the matter is you are
too close to the Chancellor.

502
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,080
The council doesn't like it when
he interferes in Jedi affairs.

503
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,113
I swear to you,

504
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:47,906
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

505
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,359
But it's what you wanted.

506
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:53,664
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

507
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:55,505
That has nothing to do with this.

508
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,945
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment,

509
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:01,013
is because the Chancellor trusts you.

510
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:03,232
And?

511
00:39:03,981 --> 00:39:05,169
Anakin, I am on your side.

512
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:06,967
I didn't want to put you in this situation.

513
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:08,232
What situation?

514
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:14,363
The council wants you to report

515
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:16,355
on all the Chancellor's dealings.

516
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,402
They want to know what he's up to.

517
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,685
They want me to spy
on the Chancellor.

518
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:27,795
But that's treason.

519
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,030
We are at war, Anakin.

520
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,177
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

521
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:36,731
This assignment does
not to be on record.

522
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:40,157
The Chancellor is not
a bad man, Obi-Wan.

523
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,042
He befriended me.

524
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:44,033
He's watched out for me
ever since I arrived here.

525
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,818
That is why you must help us.

526
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,667
Anakin.

527
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,384
Our allegiance is to the senate,

528
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,404
not to its leader,

529
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:51,685
who has managed to stay in office,

530
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,466
long after his term has expired.

531
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,665
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

532
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:57,282
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.

533
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,752
Something is out of place.

534
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:02,871
You're asking me to do
something against the Jedi code...

535
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:05,397
against the Republic,

536
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,450
against a mentor and a friend.

537
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,640
That was out of place here.

538
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,333
Why are you asking this of me?

539
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,185
The council is asking you.

540
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,701
Anakin did not take to his new,

541
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,422
assignment with much enthusiasm.

542
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:30,259
It's very dangerous
putting them together.

543
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,543
I don't think the boy could handle it.

544
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,607
I don't trust him.

545
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,342
With all due respect Master,

546
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,857
is he not the chosen one?

547
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,702
Is he not to destroy the Sith,

548
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,435
and bring balance to the Force?

549
00:40:44,232 --> 00:40:45,661
So the prophecy says.

550
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,965
A prophecy...

551
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,431
that misread...

552
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,034
could have been.

553
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,686
He will not let me down.

554
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,453
He never has.

555
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:59,464
I hope right you are.

556
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:27,725
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

557
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,684
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

558
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,461
Have you ever considered that
we may be on the wrong side?

559
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:38,740
What do you mean?

560
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,297
What if the democracy we thought,

561
00:41:42,322 --> 00:41:44,008
we were serving no longer exists.

562
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:46,614
And the Republic has become
the very evil,

563
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:47,977
we've been fighting to destroy?

564
00:41:49,012 --> 00:41:50,121
I don't believe that.

565
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,475
And you're sounding like a separatist.

566
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:56,793
This war represents
a failure to listen.

567
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:00,039
Now you're closer to the
Chancellor than anyone, please,

568
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

569
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,140
Don't ask me to do that.

570
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:08,456
Make a motion in the senate,

571
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,263
where that kind of a request belongs.

572
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:12,722
What is it?

573
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:13,803
Nothing.

574
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:16,405
Don't do this.

575
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:18,653
Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

576
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:22,716
Hold me.

577
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:25,292
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

578
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,294
So long ago, when there
was nothing but our love.

579
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,807
No politics,

580
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:33,777
no plotting, no war.

581
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:14,727
You wanted to see me, Chancellor.

582
00:43:14,752 --> 00:43:15,907
Yes, Anakin.

583
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:16,848
Come closer.

584
00:43:16,873 --> 00:43:18,036
I have good news.

585
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:21,995
Our clone intelligence units,

586
00:43:21,996 --> 00:43:24,666
have discovered the location
of General Grievous.

587
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:25,818
He's hiding...

588
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:27,380
in the Utapau system.

589
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,605
At last.

590
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:33,039
We'll be able to capture that
monster and end this war.

591
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:36,310
I would worry about
the collective wisdow

592
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:39,511
of the council if it didn't select
you for this assignment.

593
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:40,980
You're the best choice...

594
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:42,444
by far.

595
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:46,905
Sit down.

596
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,554
Leave us.

597
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,636
Anakin.

598
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:05,873
You know I'm not able to rely...

599
00:44:05,874 --> 00:44:07,661
on the Jedi Council.

600
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:11,727
If they haven't included you in their plot,

601
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:13,028
they soon will.

602
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,338
I'm not sure I understand.

603
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,163
You must sense what
I have come to suspect.

604
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:22,946
The Jedi Council
want control of the Republic.

605
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:26,283
They're planing to betray me.

606
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,704
I don't think...
Anakin.

607
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:32,236
Search your feelings.

608
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:35,960
You know?

609
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:37,461
Don't you?

610
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,400
I know they don't trust you.

611
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:45,226
Or the senate.

612
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:46,817
Or the Republic.

613
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,349
Or democracy for that matter.

614
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:51,720
I have to admit...

615
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:54,463
my trust in them has been shaken.

616
00:44:55,556 --> 00:44:56,556
Why?

617
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,714
They asked you to do something,

618
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,717
that made you feel dishonest,
didn't they?

619
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,232
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?

620
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:14,540
I don't...

621
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:17,766
I don't know what to say.

622
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,986
Remember back
to your early teachings.

623
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:24,012
All who gain power...

624
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:26,121
are afraid to lose it.

625
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,673
Even the Jedi.

626
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:30,074
The Jedi use their power for good.

627
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:32,880
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

628
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,143
The Sith and the Jedi,

629
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:38,307
are similar in almost every way...

630
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:42,837
including their quest
for greater power.

631
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,156
The Sith rely on their
passion for their strength.

632
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:50,257
They think inwards only
about themselves.

633
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:53,331
And the Jedi don't.

634
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,319
The Jedi are selfless.

635
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,522
They only care about others.

636
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:09,940
Did you ever hear,

637
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:13,748
the tragedy of Darth Plagueis
the Wise?

638
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,022
No.

639
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,194
I thought not.

640
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,578
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

641
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:26,152
It's a Sith legend.

642
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:28,631
Darth Plagueis...

643
00:46:29,098 --> 00:46:31,070
was a dark lord of the Sith,

644
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,406
so powerful and so wise,

645
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:36,414
he could use the Force,

646
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:38,852
to influence the midi-chlorians...

647
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:40,756
to create...

648
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,748
life.

649
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:47,419
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side,

650
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:49,613
he could even,

651
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:52,205
keep the ones he cared about...

652
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,612
from dying.

653
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,229
He could actually...

654
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:02,516
save people from death?

655
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,584
The dark side of the Force,

656
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:08,302
is the path way to many abilities,

657
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:12,129
some consider to be unnatural.

658
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:15,090
What happened to him?

659
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:18,393
He became so powerful,

660
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,950
the only thing he was afraid of was...

661
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:24,917
losing his power.

662
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:27,366
Which eventually, of course, he did.

663
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,772
Unfortunately...

664
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,062
he taught his apprentice,

665
00:47:32,087 --> 00:47:33,592
everything he knew.

666
00:47:34,564 --> 00:47:37,166
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

667
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:41,401
It's ironic.

668
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:44,357
He could save others from death...

669
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,207
but not himself.

670
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:54,097
Is it possible to learn this power?

671
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:00,010
Not from a Jedi.

672
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:18,871
All Red units, over here!

673
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:20,539
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

674
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:33,384
<i>Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?</i>

675
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:36,904
<i>A partial message was
intercepted in a diplomatic packet,</i>

676
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:38,173
<i>from the chairman of Utapau.</i>

677
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,911
<i>Act on this we must.</i>

678
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,781
<i>The capture of General Grievous,</i>

679
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:48,377
<i>will end this war.</i>

680
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:50,746
<i>Quickly and decisively,</i>

681
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,237
<i>we should proceed.</i>

682
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:54,537
The Chancellor has requested,

683
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:56,918
that I lead the campaign.

684
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:00,393
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go,

685
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:02,173
not the Chancellor.

686
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,624
<i>A master is needed,</i>

687
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:07,005
<i>with more experience.</i>

688
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:08,856
<i>I concur.</i>

689
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,247
<i>Master Kenobi should go.</i>

690
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,009
<i>I agree.</i>

691
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:15,521
<i>Aye.</i>
Aye.

692
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:18,667
<i>Very well.
Council adjourned.</i>

693
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:29,262
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

694
00:49:30,232 --> 00:49:32,261
Then now the time is,

695
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:33,444
Commander.

696
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:34,651
Yes, sir.

697
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,551
Charge!

698
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:05,021
Head for cover!

699
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,196
Your gonna need me
on this one, Master.

700
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:24,404
Oh, I agree.

701
00:50:24,545 --> 00:50:27,321
However, it may turn out just
to be a wild bantha chase.

702
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,707
Master.

703
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:31,918
I disappointed you.

704
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:35,354
I haven't been very
appreciative of your training.

705
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,334
I've been arrogant,

706
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:39,568
and I apologize.

707
00:50:40,572 --> 00:50:42,758
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

708
00:50:46,183 --> 00:50:48,154
You are strong and wise, Anakin,

709
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,881
and I am very proud of you.

710
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,315
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

711
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,425
I have taught you everything I know.

712
00:50:55,107 --> 00:50:56,873
And you have become
a far greater Jedi

713
00:50:56,874 --> 00:50:58,090
than I could ever hope to be.

714
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,544
But be patient, Anakin.

715
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:05,643
It will not be long before the
council makes you a Jedi master.

716
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:13,856
Obi-Wan.

717
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:15,982
May the Force be with you.

718
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:17,674
Goodbye, old friend.

719
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:19,188
May the Force be with you.

720
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:43,777
Fortunately, most of the cities,

721
00:51:43,778 --> 00:51:46,231
are concentrated on
this small continent here.

722
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:47,560
On the far side.

723
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,276
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

724
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:51,790
Just don't take too long.

725
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:54,159
Come on.
When have I ever let you down?

726
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:56,597
Very well.

727
00:51:56,673 --> 00:51:58,182
The burden is on me not to destroy,

728
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:00,316
all the droids until you arrive.

729
00:52:26,596 --> 00:52:27,701
Save your energy.

730
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:29,385
I can't.

731
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,526
Don't give up, Padmé.

732
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,265
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

733
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:49,587
He came by this morning.

734
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:52,884
What did he want?

735
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:55,431
He's worried about you.

736
00:52:58,088 --> 00:52:59,898
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

737
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:04,605
I feel lost.

738
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:06,888
Lost?

739
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:08,747
What do you mean?

740
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:13,092
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

741
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:16,530
They trust you with their lives.

742
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:19,981
Something's happening.

743
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:23,034
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

744
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:27,382
I want more.

745
00:53:29,223 --> 00:53:30,303
That I know I shouldn't.

746
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,834
You expect too much of yourself.

747
00:53:39,077 --> 00:53:40,807
I found a way to save you.

748
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:41,889
Save me?

749
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,241
From my nightmares.

750
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:46,176
Is that what's bothering you?

751
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:49,171
I won't lose you, Padmé.

752
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,922
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

753
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:53,204
I promise you.

754
00:53:53,205 --> 00:53:54,402
No, I promise you.

755
00:54:38,686 --> 00:54:40,507
Greetings, young Jedi.

756
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:44,411
What brings you
to our remote sanctuary?

757
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:46,587
Unfortunately, the war.

758
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:48,622
There's no war here.

759
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,218
Unless you brought it with you.

760
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,126
With your kind permission,

761
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:54,330
I should like some fuel...

762
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:58,118
and to use your city as a base
as I search nearby systems...

763
00:54:58,276 --> 00:54:59,738
for General Grievous.

764
00:55:08,646 --> 00:55:09,714
He is here.

765
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,334
We are being held hostage.

766
00:55:12,335 --> 00:55:13,631
They are watching us.

767
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:14,673
I understand.

768
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,676
Tenth level,

769
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:19,622
thousands of battle droids.

770
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:22,069
Tell your people to take shelter.

771
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,958
If you have warriors,

772
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,408
now is the time.

773
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:37,797
Take the fighter back to the ship.

774
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:38,867
Tell Cody...

775
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,500
I've made contact.

776
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,961
Is he bringing additional warriors?

777
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,638
He didn't say.

778
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:30,714
It won't be long,

779
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:33,133
before the armies of the Republic,

780
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:34,431
track us here.

781
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,176
I am sending you,

782
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:40,059
to the Mustafar system,

783
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,694
in the outer rim.

784
00:56:49,863 --> 00:56:51,682
It is the volcanic planet.

785
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,165
You will be safe there.

786
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:55,200
Safe?

787
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,677
Chancellor Palpatine managed,

788
00:56:57,702 --> 00:56:59,260
to escape your grip, General.

789
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,046
Without Count Dooku,

790
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:04,271
I have doubts about your
ability to keep us safe.

791
00:57:04,824 --> 00:57:06,797
Be thankful, Viceroy.

792
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:10,146
You have not found yourself
in my grip.

793
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:16,269
Your ship is waiting.

794
00:57:34,308 --> 00:57:35,250
Hello there.

795
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:39,614
General Kenobi.

796
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:44,732
You are a bold one.

797
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,546
Kill him.

798
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:05,984
Back away!

799
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,121
I will deal with this Jedi slime,

800
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:10,462
myself.

801
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,020
Your move.

802
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:14,719
You fool!

803
00:58:15,044 --> 00:58:17,959
I been trained in you Jedi arts...

804
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:20,134
by Count Dooku.

805
00:58:27,093 --> 00:58:28,253
Attack.

806
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:29,441
Kenobi!

807
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:28,114
Go, go, go, go!

808
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:29,336
Move it! Move it!

809
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:30,425
Everybody out.

810
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,937
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

811
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:33,250
Cover yourself. Come on.

812
00:59:38,569 --> 00:59:40,772
Move it! Move it!

813
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:45,125
Come on, move!
Come on, everybody!

814
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:47,694
Army or not.

815
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,203
You must realize.

816
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:53,367
You are doomed.

817
00:59:53,813 --> 00:59:55,055
Oh, I don't think so.

818
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:55,334
Cover that corner.

819
01:01:01,913 --> 01:01:02,940
<i>Master Windu,</i>

820
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,037
<i>may I interrupt?</i>

821
01:01:04,444 --> 01:01:06,774
<i>General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous,</i>

822
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,953
<i>and we have begun our attack.</i>

823
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,272
Thank you, Commander.

824
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:12,293
Anakin,

825
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,893
deliver this report to the Chancellor.

826
01:01:15,427 --> 01:01:17,750
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

827
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:19,254
Yes, Master.

828
01:01:26,622 --> 01:01:28,994
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

829
01:01:29,996 --> 01:01:32,692
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the Chancellor.

830
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:35,606
<i>If he does not give up
his emergency powers,</i>

831
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,153
<i>after the destruction of Grievous,</i>

832
01:01:37,154 --> 01:01:39,708
<i>then he should be
removed from office.</i>

833
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,621
The Jedi Council would have
to take control of the senate,

834
01:01:43,622 --> 01:01:45,604
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

835
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:50,429
<i>To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.</i>

836
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:55,337
<i>Great care we must take.</i>

837
01:02:01,988 --> 01:02:03,059
Chancellor.

838
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:06,656
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

839
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,373
He has engaged General Grievous.

840
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:12,989
We can only hope that Master
Kenobi is up to the challenge.

841
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:16,328
I should be there with him.

842
01:02:16,973 --> 01:02:18,722
It's upsetting to me to see,

843
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:21,606
that the council doesn't seem
to fully appreciate your talents.

844
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:24,117
Don't you wonder...

845
01:02:24,316 --> 01:02:26,621
why they won't make you
a Jedi master?

846
01:02:28,649 --> 01:02:29,742
I wish I knew.

847
01:02:31,922 --> 01:02:33,699
More and more I get the feeling that...

848
01:02:34,575 --> 01:02:36,463
I'm being excluded from the council.

849
01:02:43,724 --> 01:02:45,224
I know there are things about,

850
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:47,019
the Force that they're not telling me.

851
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,809
They don't trust you, Anakin.

852
01:02:53,146 --> 01:02:54,600
They see your future.

853
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,954
They know your power will be
too strong to control.

854
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,187
You must break through
the fog of lies...

855
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,315
the Jedi have created around you.

856
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,874
Let me help you to know...

857
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,964
the subtleties of the Force.

858
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:14,335
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

859
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:18,183
My mentor taught me everything
about the Force.

860
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:21,853
Even the nature of the dark side.

861
01:03:24,707 --> 01:03:25,958
You know the dark side?

862
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:28,514
Anakin.

863
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:32,520
If one is to understand
the great mystery,

864
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:35,059
one must study all its aspects,

865
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,489
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

866
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,931
If you wish to become a complete,

867
01:03:41,256 --> 01:03:43,465
and wise leader you must embrace...

868
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:45,579
a larger view of the Force.

869
01:03:46,747 --> 01:03:48,552
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

870
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:52,754
Only through me
can you achieve a power,

871
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:54,700
greater than any Jedi.

872
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:58,739
Learn to know the dark side
of the force,

873
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,241
and you'll be able to save your wife...

874
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:03,850
from certain death.

875
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:06,872
What did you say?

876
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:09,346
Use my knowledge,

877
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:10,355
I beg you.

878
01:04:12,606 --> 01:04:13,723
Your the Sith lord.

879
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:17,055
I know what's been troubling you.

880
01:04:17,716 --> 01:04:18,771
Listen to me.

881
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:23,182
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

882
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,731
Ever since I've known you
you've been searching for a life...

883
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,351
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

884
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,841
A life of significance...

885
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,521
of conscience.

886
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:42,224
Are you going to kill me?

887
01:04:43,105 --> 01:04:44,497
I would certainly like to.

888
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,795
I know you would.

889
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:52,218
I can feel your anger.

890
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:55,025
It gives you focus...

891
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:57,245
makes you stronger.

892
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:06,325
I'm going to turn you
over to the Jedi Council.

893
01:05:06,684 --> 01:05:08,195
Of course. You should.

894
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,222
But you're not sure of
their intentions, are you?

895
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:13,939
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

896
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:17,316
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

897
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:20,435
Know the power of the dark side.

898
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:23,912
Power to save Padmé.

899
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:33,947
So uncivilized.

900
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,248
Master Windu.

901
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:43,555
I must talk to you.

902
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,580
Skywalker.

903
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,646
We just received word that Obi-Wan
has destroyed General Grievous.

904
01:07:47,674 --> 01:07:49,716
We're on our way to make
sure the Chancellor returns

905
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,379
emergency power back
to the senate.

906
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:52,911
He won't give up his power.

907
01:07:53,456 --> 01:07:54,848
I've just learned a terrible truth.

908
01:07:55,474 --> 01:07:57,506
I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.

909
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:00,605
A Sith lord?

910
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:03,445
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

911
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:04,716
How do you know this?

912
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:06,654
He knows the ways of the Force.

913
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:09,498
He's been trained to use the dark side.

914
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:11,430
Are you sure?

915
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:12,592
Absolutely.

916
01:08:14,287 --> 01:08:16,266
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

917
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:19,511
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

918
01:08:20,365 --> 01:08:22,544
Master, the Chancellor
is very powerful.

919
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,067
You'll need my help if
you're going to arrest him.

920
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:27,845
For your own good,
stay out of this affair.

921
01:08:28,227 --> 01:08:31,081
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

922
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:33,121
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

923
01:08:33,146 --> 01:08:34,506
I must go, Master.

924
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:35,498
No.

925
01:08:37,537 --> 01:08:39,084
If what you've told me is true,

926
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:41,280
you will have gained my trust.

927
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,083
But for now, remain here.

928
01:08:45,419 --> 01:08:47,846
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

929
01:08:50,272 --> 01:08:51,478
Yes, Master.

930
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,935
<i>You do know, don't you,</i>

931
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:26,803
<i>if the Jedi destroy me,</i>

932
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:30,264
<i>any chance of saving
her will be lost.</i>

933
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:01,080
Master Windu.

934
01:11:01,104 --> 01:11:03,557
I take it General Grievous
is been destroyed then.

935
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,136
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

936
01:11:07,994 --> 01:11:10,643
In the name of the Galactic
Senate of the Republic.

937
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,391
Your under arrest, Chancellor.

938
01:11:13,495 --> 01:11:15,488
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

939
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,674
The senate will decide your fate.

940
01:11:18,026 --> 01:11:20,314
I am the senate.

941
01:11:20,338 --> 01:11:21,502
Not yet.

942
01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:28,200
It's treason...

943
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:29,665
then.

944
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,616
You are under arrest my lord.

945
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:14,300
Anakin.

946
01:13:14,325 --> 01:13:15,921
I told you it would come to this.

947
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,434
I was right.

948
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:19,643
The Jedi are taking over!

949
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:22,133
The impression of the Sith
will never return.

950
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:24,220
You have lost.

951
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:26,098
No.

952
01:13:26,838 --> 01:13:28,535
No, no!

953
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:30,126
You will die!

954
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:34,950
He's a traitor!

955
01:13:35,301 --> 01:13:37,156
He is the traitor!

956
01:13:40,747 --> 01:13:44,301
I have the power
to save the ones you love.

957
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:47,335
You must choose!

958
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:50,602
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

959
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:54,331
Don't let it kill me.

960
01:13:58,128 --> 01:14:00,108
I can't hold on any longer!

961
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:02,910
I can't.

962
01:14:02,935 --> 01:14:04,111
I'm weak.

963
01:14:04,136 --> 01:14:05,244
I'm...

964
01:14:05,269 --> 01:14:06,470
I'm too weak.

965
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,007
Anakin!

966
01:14:08,117 --> 01:14:09,252
Help me!

967
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:10,276
Help me!

968
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,836
I can't hold on any longer.

969
01:14:17,448 --> 01:14:20,339
I am going to end this once and for all.

970
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:21,737
You can't.

971
01:14:22,878 --> 01:14:24,240
He must stand trial.

972
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:27,847
He has control of the senate
and the courts!

973
01:14:27,972 --> 01:14:30,198
He's too dangerous to be left alive!

974
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:31,606
I'm too weak.

975
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:33,681
Oh, don't kill me.

976
01:14:34,029 --> 01:14:34,619
Please.

977
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,148
It's not the Jedi way!

978
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,081
He must live!

979
01:14:41,174 --> 01:14:42,176
Please don't!

980
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:43,315
I need him!

981
01:14:44,806 --> 01:14:45,814
Please don't!

982
01:14:45,885 --> 01:14:47,090
No!

983
01:14:52,932 --> 01:14:54,621
Power!

984
01:15:01,321 --> 01:15:04,417
Unlimited...

985
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,994
power!

986
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:18,945
What have I done?

987
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:31,050
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

988
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:35,224
Become my apprentice.

989
01:15:35,482 --> 01:15:40,326
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

990
01:15:43,654 --> 01:15:45,069
I will do whatever you...

991
01:15:45,528 --> 01:15:46,538
ask.

992
01:15:48,693 --> 01:15:50,123
Good.

993
01:15:52,817 --> 01:15:54,909
Just help me save Padmé's life.

994
01:15:57,504 --> 01:15:59,081
I can't live without her.

995
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:04,074
To cheat death...

996
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:07,880
is a power only one has achieved,

997
01:16:07,904 --> 01:16:10,928
but if we work together...

998
01:16:11,547 --> 01:16:14,914
I know we can discover the secret.

999
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:18,762
I pledge myself...

1000
01:16:20,896 --> 01:16:22,237
to your teachings.

1001
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,056
Good.

1002
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:28,031
Good.

1003
01:16:36,773 --> 01:16:41,015
The force is strong with you.

1004
01:16:41,842 --> 01:16:46,135
A powerful Sith you will become.

1005
01:16:47,257 --> 01:16:48,392
Henceforth.

1006
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,045
You should be known has...

1007
01:16:51,304 --> 01:16:52,413
Darth...

1008
01:16:54,122 --> 01:16:55,296
Vader.

1009
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,188
Thank you,

1010
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:02,976
my master.

1011
01:17:05,257 --> 01:17:06,269
Rise.

1012
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,499
Because the council did not trust
you my young apprentice,

1013
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:29,518
I believe you are the only Jedi

1014
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:31,553
with no knowledge of this plot.

1015
01:17:33,152 --> 01:17:35,958
When the Jedi learn what
has transpired here,

1016
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:37,003
they will kill us,

1017
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:40,243
along with all the senators.

1018
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,263
I agree.

1019
01:17:43,044 --> 01:17:44,486
The council's next move...

1020
01:17:44,912 --> 01:17:46,144
will be against the senate.

1021
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,466
Every single Jedi...

1022
01:17:49,684 --> 01:17:51,282
including your friend...

1023
01:17:51,744 --> 01:17:53,060
Obi-Wan Kenobi,

1024
01:17:53,247 --> 01:17:56,419
is now an enemy of the Republic.

1025
01:17:57,795 --> 01:17:59,341
I understand, Master.

1026
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:01,578
We must move quickly.

1027
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:03,943
The Jedi are relentless.

1028
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:06,465
If they are not all destroyed,

1029
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:09,870
it will be civil war without end.

1030
01:18:12,045 --> 01:18:13,068
First...

1031
01:18:13,225 --> 01:18:15,839
I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

1032
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,121
We will catch them off-balance.

1033
01:18:20,537 --> 01:18:23,848
Do what must be done Lord Vader.

1034
01:18:24,302 --> 01:18:25,513
Do not hesitate.

1035
01:18:25,809 --> 01:18:27,393
Show no mercy.

1036
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:29,376
Only then,

1037
01:18:29,401 --> 01:18:31,208
when you'll be strong enough...

1038
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:35,016
with the dark side to save Padmé.

1039
01:18:36,802 --> 01:18:38,282
What about the other Jedi,

1040
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:39,735
spread across the galaxy?

1041
01:18:40,184 --> 01:18:43,046
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

1042
01:18:45,177 --> 01:18:46,581
After you have killed

1043
01:18:46,606 --> 01:18:48,471
all the Jedi in the temple,

1044
01:18:48,631 --> 01:18:51,008
go the Mustafar system.

1045
01:18:51,451 --> 01:18:52,441
Wipeout...

1046
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:53,697
Viceroy,

1047
01:18:53,698 --> 01:18:54,704
Gunray,

1048
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:57,401
and the other separatist leaders.

1049
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:03,888
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

1050
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,698
And...

1051
01:19:07,295 --> 01:19:09,950
we shall have...

1052
01:19:10,676 --> 01:19:11,749
peace.

1053
01:19:55,856 --> 01:19:56,861
Sergeant, over here!

1054
01:19:58,637 --> 01:20:00,184
Hurry! Follow them!

1055
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:05,225
All Red units, let's move it!

1056
01:20:21,074 --> 01:20:22,920
Commander, contact your troops.

1057
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:25,079
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

1058
01:20:25,324 --> 01:20:26,325
Very good, sir.

1059
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:29,248
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

1060
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:31,950
Thank you, Cody.
Now let's get a move on.

1061
01:20:31,975 --> 01:20:33,362
We've got a battle to win here.

1062
01:20:33,387 --> 01:20:34,431
Yes, sir.

1063
01:20:41,692 --> 01:20:43,363
<i>Commander Cody.</i>

1064
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,817
The time has come.

1065
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:50,990
Execute order 66.

1066
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:53,648
Yes, my lord.

1067
01:20:58,464 --> 01:20:59,451
Blast him!

1068
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:27,250
Come on!

1069
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:21,590
<i>Execute order 66.</i>

1070
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,199
It will be done, my lord.

1071
01:23:06,954 --> 01:23:08,542
It will be done, my lord.

1072
01:23:45,839 --> 01:23:47,179
Master Skywalker.

1073
01:23:47,204 --> 01:23:48,652
There too many of them.

1074
01:23:48,698 --> 01:23:50,053
What are we going to do?

1075
01:24:00,622 --> 01:24:02,458
The Chancellor's office indicated,

1076
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:03,815
Master Anakin returned...

1077
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,159
to the Jedi temple.

1078
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:06,664
Don't worry.

1079
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:07,940
I'm sure he'll be alright.

1080
01:24:37,581 --> 01:24:38,621
What's going on here?

1081
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:40,230
There's been a rebellion, sir.

1082
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:42,790
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

1083
01:24:43,482 --> 01:24:44,786
I'm sorry, sir.

1084
01:24:44,957 --> 01:24:46,439
It's time for you to leave.

1085
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,291
And so it is.

1086
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,556
Get him!

1087
01:25:07,446 --> 01:25:08,446
No!

1088
01:25:13,058 --> 01:25:14,986
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

1089
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:44,003
All these Wookies are dead.

1090
01:25:44,028 --> 01:25:45,032
Move to the east.

1091
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,057
Yes, sir.

1092
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,414
Good-bye, Tarfful.

1093
01:25:56,841 --> 01:25:58,641
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

1094
01:26:01,192 --> 01:26:03,017
Miss you, I will.

1095
01:26:40,567 --> 01:26:42,902
Hopefully we'll be able to intercept
a few Jedi,

1096
01:26:43,004 --> 01:26:44,997
before they walk into this catastrophe.

1097
01:26:51,401 --> 01:26:52,529
Did you find Kenobi?

1098
01:26:53,011 --> 01:26:54,980
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

1099
01:26:56,035 --> 01:26:57,708
Start loading your men on the ships.

1100
01:26:58,683 --> 01:26:59,683
Move it!

1101
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:35,289
Emergency code 913.

1102
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:37,523
I have no contact on any frequency.

1103
01:27:39,859 --> 01:27:40,867
<i>Master Kenobi.</i>

1104
01:27:41,492 --> 01:27:43,364
Repeat.
<i>Master Kenobi.</i>

1105
01:27:43,656 --> 01:27:44,873
Senator Organa.

1106
01:27:45,455 --> 01:27:47,649
My clone troops turned on me.
I need help.

1107
01:27:48,499 --> 01:27:50,250
<i>We have just rescued Master Yoda.</i>

1108
01:27:50,251 --> 01:27:52,231
<i>It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.</i>

1109
01:27:52,555 --> 01:27:53,910
<i>We're sending you our coordinates.</i>

1110
01:28:02,919 --> 01:28:04,411
Hush! Not so loud.

1111
01:28:04,633 --> 01:28:05,835
Are you alright?

1112
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,712
I heard there was an
attack on the Jedi temple.

1113
01:28:07,737 --> 01:28:09,076
You could see the smoke from here.

1114
01:28:09,101 --> 01:28:10,304
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1115
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:12,036
I came to see if you
and the baby are safe.

1116
01:28:12,813 --> 01:28:13,820
What's happening?

1117
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,809
The Jedi have tried
to overthrow the Republic.

1118
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:19,250
I can't believe that.

1119
01:28:19,951 --> 01:28:23,186
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the Chancellor myself.

1120
01:28:24,507 --> 01:28:25,511
Oh, Anakin.

1121
01:28:26,227 --> 01:28:27,441
What are you gonna do?

1122
01:28:36,397 --> 01:28:38,255
I will not betray the Republic.

1123
01:28:40,584 --> 01:28:42,426
My loyalties lie with the Chancellor,

1124
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:44,854
and with the senate,

1125
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:46,569
and with you.

1126
01:28:47,341 --> 01:28:48,661
What about Obi-Wan?

1127
01:28:49,124 --> 01:28:50,149
I don't know.

1128
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:52,774
Many Jedi have been killed.

1129
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,181
We can only hope that he's
remained loyal to the Chancellor.

1130
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:59,054
Anakin, I'm afraid.

1131
01:29:02,631 --> 01:29:03,936
Have faith in my love.

1132
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,469
Everything will soon be set right.

1133
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,327
The Chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

1134
01:29:11,095 --> 01:29:13,708
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

1135
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:16,391
I'm going there to end this war.

1136
01:29:16,983 --> 01:29:18,462
Wait for me until I return.

1137
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:20,870
Things will be different.
I promise.

1138
01:29:26,857 --> 01:29:28,267
Please, wait for me.

1139
01:29:33,397 --> 01:29:35,574
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

1140
01:29:38,077 --> 01:29:39,531
Take care, my little friend.

1141
01:29:44,624 --> 01:29:45,634
Oh, my lady,

1142
01:29:45,752 --> 01:29:47,321
is there anything I might do?

1143
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:49,793
No, thank you, 3PO.

1144
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:53,495
I feel so...

1145
01:29:54,283 --> 01:29:55,328
helpless.

1146
01:30:18,849 --> 01:30:21,029
How many other Jedi have
managed to survive?

1147
01:30:21,858 --> 01:30:23,936
Heard from no one have we.

1148
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:28,187
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

1149
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:30,019
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

1150
01:30:30,209 --> 01:30:32,161
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

1151
01:30:32,725 --> 01:30:35,452
Received a coded retreat
message we have.

1152
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,484
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

1153
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:41,247
It says the war is over.

1154
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:42,777
Well, then we must go back.

1155
01:30:43,421 --> 01:30:46,696
If there are any stragglers, they
will fall into the trap and be killed.

1156
01:30:48,088 --> 01:30:51,772
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

1157
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,520
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

1158
01:30:55,842 --> 01:30:57,042
I agree.

1159
01:30:57,623 --> 01:31:00,751
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

1160
01:31:22,317 --> 01:31:25,471
The plan has gone as you
had promised, my lord.

1161
01:31:25,551 --> 01:31:28,743
<i>You have done well Viceroy.</i>

1162
01:31:28,768 --> 01:31:31,139
<i>When my new apprentice</i>

1163
01:31:31,661 --> 01:31:33,866
<i>Darth Vader arrives,</i>

1164
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:37,596
<i>he will take care of you.</i>

1165
01:31:50,283 --> 01:31:52,770
We're receiving a message
from the Chancellor's office, sir.

1166
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:54,039
Send it through.
Yes, sir.

1167
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,581
<i>Senator Organa.</i>

1168
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:01,198
<i>The supreme Chancellor
requests your presence,</i>

1169
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,935
<i>at a special session of Congress.</i>

1170
01:32:03,482 --> 01:32:04,630
I will be there.

1171
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:06,941
<i>He'll be expecting you.</i>

1172
01:32:10,017 --> 01:32:11,019
Could be a trap.

1173
01:32:12,058 --> 01:32:13,074
I don't think so.

1174
01:32:13,587 --> 01:32:15,371
The Chancellor will not be able to control,

1175
01:32:15,372 --> 01:32:16,682
the thousands of star systems,

1176
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,645
without keeping the senate intact.

1177
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:22,316
If a special session
of Congress there is,

1178
01:32:22,644 --> 01:32:26,144
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

1179
01:33:04,482 --> 01:33:05,900
R2, stay with the ship.

1180
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:33,130
Welcome, Lord Vader.

1181
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:34,593
We've been expecting you.

1182
01:34:06,623 --> 01:34:08,899
<i>And the Jedi rebellion</i>

1183
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,527
<i>has been foiled.</i>

1184
01:34:11,552 --> 01:34:12,340
What's happened?

1185
01:34:12,365 --> 01:34:14,965
The Chancellor's been elaborating
on a plot by the Jedi,

1186
01:34:15,184 --> 01:34:16,832
to overthrow the senate.

1187
01:34:17,488 --> 01:34:22,782
<i>And the remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated!</i>

1188
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,552
Not even the younglings survived.

1189
01:34:42,161 --> 01:34:44,246
Killed not by clones,

1190
01:34:44,606 --> 01:34:45,326
this...

1191
01:34:46,196 --> 01:34:47,215
Padawan.

1192
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:50,668
By a lightsaber he was.

1193
01:34:57,848 --> 01:34:58,584
Who?

1194
01:34:59,656 --> 01:35:00,906
Who could have done this?

1195
01:35:12,692 --> 01:35:14,688
<i>The attempt on my life,</i>

1196
01:35:15,512 --> 01:35:17,505
<i>has left me scarred,</i>

1197
01:35:18,652 --> 01:35:20,349
<i>and deformed.</i>

1198
01:35:21,723 --> 01:35:23,697
<i>But I assure you.</i>

1199
01:35:24,323 --> 01:35:29,272
<i>My resolve has never
been stronger!</i>

1200
01:35:33,546 --> 01:35:34,346
Stop!

1201
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:35,528
No!

1202
01:35:47,431 --> 01:35:50,751
<i>In order to ensure the security,</i>

1203
01:35:50,752 --> 01:35:53,212
<i>and continuing stability,</i>

1204
01:35:53,845 --> 01:35:55,127
<i>the Republic,</i>

1205
01:35:55,252 --> 01:35:57,146
<i>will be reorganized...</i>

1206
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:59,258
<i>into the first...</i>

1207
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:02,768
<i>Galactic Empire!</i>

1208
01:36:03,516 --> 01:36:04,769
<i>For a safe...</i>

1209
01:36:05,194 --> 01:36:07,412
<i>and secure...</i>

1210
01:36:08,213 --> 01:36:09,589
<i>society!</i>

1211
01:36:18,964 --> 01:36:20,738
So, this is how liberty dies.

1212
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:23,783
With thunderous applause.

1213
01:36:27,064 --> 01:36:28,353
The war is over.

1214
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,231
Lord Sidious...

1215
01:36:30,607 --> 01:36:31,710
promised us peace.

1216
01:36:32,415 --> 01:36:33,564
We only want...

1217
01:36:41,305 --> 01:36:42,817
I have recalibrated the code,

1218
01:36:42,842 --> 01:36:45,505
warning all surviving
Jedi to stay away.

1219
01:36:46,393 --> 01:36:47,923
For the clones,

1220
01:36:48,588 --> 01:36:50,393
to discover the recalibration,

1221
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,727
a long time it will take.

1222
01:37:05,094 --> 01:37:06,138
Wait. Master.

1223
01:37:08,174 --> 01:37:09,744
There is something I must know.

1224
01:37:16,526 --> 01:37:19,006
If into the security
recordings you go,

1225
01:37:19,252 --> 01:37:20,727
only pain will you find.

1226
01:37:21,689 --> 01:37:23,612
I must know the truth, Master.

1227
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:32,725
It can't be.

1228
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,135
It can't be.

1229
01:37:35,815 --> 01:37:39,189
<i>You have done well
my new apprentice.</i>

1230
01:37:39,932 --> 01:37:42,697
<i>Now Lord Vader.</i>

1231
01:37:42,729 --> 01:37:46,186
<i>Go and bring peace to the empire.</i>

1232
01:37:46,392 --> 01:37:48,021
I can't watch anymore.

1233
01:37:49,424 --> 01:37:51,078
Destory the Sith,

1234
01:37:51,454 --> 01:37:52,992
we must.

1235
01:37:55,134 --> 01:37:56,949
Send me to kill the Emperor.

1236
01:37:57,854 --> 01:37:59,307
I will not kill Anakin.

1237
01:37:59,908 --> 01:38:01,794
To fight this Lord Sidious,

1238
01:38:02,019 --> 01:38:04,116
strong enough, you are not.

1239
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:06,314
He is like my brother.

1240
01:38:06,484 --> 01:38:07,797
I cannot do it.

1241
01:38:08,432 --> 01:38:10,984
Twisted by the dark side...

1242
01:38:11,203 --> 01:38:13,047
young Skywalker has become.

1243
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:15,649
The boy you trained,

1244
01:38:15,674 --> 01:38:17,071
gone he is.

1245
01:38:17,096 --> 01:38:18,122
Consumed,

1246
01:38:18,406 --> 01:38:19,776
by Darth Vader.

1247
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,712
I do not know where
the Emperor has sent him.

1248
01:38:23,869 --> 01:38:25,144
I don't know where to look.

1249
01:38:26,846 --> 01:38:28,454
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan.

1250
01:38:28,798 --> 01:38:30,168
And find him you will.

1251
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:42,959
When was the last time you saw him?

1252
01:38:43,908 --> 01:38:44,924
Yesterday.

1253
01:38:45,244 --> 01:38:46,778
And do you know where he is now?

1254
01:38:48,221 --> 01:38:49,223
No.

1255
01:38:50,378 --> 01:38:51,386
Padmé.

1256
01:38:52,418 --> 01:38:53,556
I need your help.

1257
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:55,739
He's in grave danger.

1258
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:56,764
From the Sith?

1259
01:38:57,713 --> 01:38:58,822
From himself.

1260
01:39:01,619 --> 01:39:02,709
Padmé.

1261
01:39:03,675 --> 01:39:05,825
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

1262
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:07,616
You're wrong.

1263
01:39:07,936 --> 01:39:09,362
How could you even say that?

1264
01:39:12,557 --> 01:39:13,692
I've seen...

1265
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:15,487
a secruity hologram...

1266
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:17,504
of him...

1267
01:39:19,221 --> 01:39:20,543
killing younglings.

1268
01:39:20,984 --> 01:39:21,933
Not Anakin.

1269
01:39:22,697 --> 01:39:23,702
He couldn't.

1270
01:39:24,743 --> 01:39:26,195
He was deceived by a lie.

1271
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,125
We all were.

1272
01:39:27,758 --> 01:39:29,280
It appears that the Chancellor

1273
01:39:29,305 --> 01:39:31,306
is behind everything, including the war.

1274
01:39:33,485 --> 01:39:36,197
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

1275
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:38,062
After the death of Count Dooku,

1276
01:39:38,087 --> 01:39:40,172
Anakin became his new apprentice.

1277
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:47,764
I don't believe you!

1278
01:39:49,939 --> 01:39:51,002
I can't.

1279
01:39:57,173 --> 01:39:58,173
Padmé.

1280
01:39:59,736 --> 01:40:01,033
I must find him.

1281
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:05,955
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

1282
01:40:10,015 --> 01:40:12,400
He has become a
very great threat.

1283
01:40:15,002 --> 01:40:16,025
I can't.

1284
01:40:30,462 --> 01:40:32,210
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

1285
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,041
I'm so sorry.

1286
01:41:24,473 --> 01:41:26,012
Milady, let me come with you.

1287
01:41:26,037 --> 01:41:26,939
There's no danger.

1288
01:41:26,964 --> 01:41:27,977
The fighting's over.

1289
01:41:27,978 --> 01:41:28,936
And this is personal.

1290
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:30,265
As you wish, milady,

1291
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,590
but I strongly disagree.

1292
01:41:31,653 --> 01:41:33,002
I'll be alright, Captain.

1293
01:41:33,225 --> 01:41:35,154
This is something I must do myself.

1294
01:41:35,426 --> 01:41:37,231
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

1295
01:41:39,809 --> 01:41:41,018
Oh, dear.

1296
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,057
Do you know?

1297
01:41:54,058 --> 01:41:56,794
I think I'm beginning to get
the hang of this flying business.

1298
01:42:25,387 --> 01:42:28,690
<i>The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.</i>

1299
01:42:29,408 --> 01:42:31,634
It is finished, then.

1300
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:35,025
You have restored,

1301
01:42:35,258 --> 01:42:38,838
peace and justice to the galaxy.

1302
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:41,365
<i>Send a message,</i>

1303
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,197
<i>to the ships of the Trade Federation.</i>

1304
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:48,153
<i>All droid units must shut down,</i>

1305
01:42:48,378 --> 01:42:49,386
<i>immediately.</i>

1306
01:42:50,328 --> 01:42:51,645
Very good, my lord.

1307
01:43:51,311 --> 01:43:52,539
I saw your ship.

1308
01:43:56,688 --> 01:43:57,810
What are you doing out here?

1309
01:43:57,835 --> 01:43:59,201
I was so worried about you.

1310
01:44:01,008 --> 01:44:02,041
Obi-Wan...

1311
01:44:02,266 --> 01:44:04,066
told me terrible things.

1312
01:44:04,413 --> 01:44:05,514
What things?

1313
01:44:06,196 --> 01:44:07,213
He said...

1314
01:44:07,438 --> 01:44:09,182
you've turned to the dark side.

1315
01:44:09,672 --> 01:44:10,687
That you...

1316
01:44:11,992 --> 01:44:13,412
killed younglings.

1317
01:44:15,281 --> 01:44:17,625
Obi-Wan is trying to
turn you against me.

1318
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:19,582
He cares about us.

1319
01:44:20,757 --> 01:44:21,594
Us?

1320
01:44:22,617 --> 01:44:23,695
He knows.

1321
01:44:25,491 --> 01:44:26,956
He wants to help you.

1322
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:31,750
Anakin...

1323
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:33,711
all I want is your love.

1324
01:44:34,235 --> 01:44:36,093
Love won't save you, Padmé.

1325
01:44:36,358 --> 01:44:38,187
Only my new powers can do that.

1326
01:44:38,453 --> 01:44:39,765
At what cost?

1327
01:44:40,102 --> 01:44:41,999
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

1328
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:44,560
I won't lose you the way
I lost my mother.

1329
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:46,896
I am becoming more powerful

1330
01:44:46,921 --> 01:44:48,944
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

1331
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:50,601
And I'm doing it for you.

1332
01:44:51,068 --> 01:44:52,196
To protect you.

1333
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:55,242
Come away with me.

1334
01:44:56,367 --> 01:44:57,938
Help me raise our child.

1335
01:44:58,314 --> 01:45:01,060
Leave everything else
behind while we still can.

1336
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,385
Don't you see?

1337
01:45:03,112 --> 01:45:04,964
We don't have to run away anymore.

1338
01:45:06,109 --> 01:45:08,182
I've brought peace to the Republic.

1339
01:45:09,695 --> 01:45:11,664
I am more powerful
than the Chancellor.

1340
01:45:12,187 --> 01:45:13,606
II can overthrow him.

1341
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:18,250
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy,

1342
01:45:18,915 --> 01:45:20,782
make things the way
we want them to be.

1343
01:45:27,686 --> 01:45:29,218
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

1344
01:45:31,273 --> 01:45:32,422
Obi-Wan was right.

1345
01:45:33,234 --> 01:45:34,528
You've changed.

1346
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:39,272
I don't want to hear any more
about Obi-Wan.

1347
01:45:40,515 --> 01:45:42,103
The Jedi turned against me.

1348
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:43,774
Don't you turn against me.

1349
01:45:45,749 --> 01:45:47,172
I don't know anymore.

1350
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:50,402
Anakin!

1351
01:45:51,327 --> 01:45:52,866
You're breaking my heart!

1352
01:45:53,918 --> 01:45:56,816
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

1353
01:45:58,063 --> 01:45:59,351
Because of Obi-Wan?

1354
01:46:00,546 --> 01:46:02,041
Because of what you've done.

1355
01:46:03,064 --> 01:46:04,440
What you plan to do.

1356
01:46:06,086 --> 01:46:06,904
Stop!

1357
01:46:06,929 --> 01:46:08,305
Stop now! Come back!

1358
01:46:08,952 --> 01:46:10,024
I love you.

1359
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:11,846
Liar!

1360
01:46:14,805 --> 01:46:15,820
No!

1361
01:46:16,547 --> 01:46:17,597
You're with him!

1362
01:46:18,409 --> 01:46:20,157
You brought him here to kill me.

1363
01:46:20,157 --> 01:46:21,290
No!

1364
01:46:22,063 --> 01:46:23,193
Let her go, Anakin!

1365
01:46:24,703 --> 01:46:26,003
Anakin.

1366
01:46:26,641 --> 01:46:28,563
Let her go!

1367
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:40,467
You turn her againest me!

1368
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,255
You have done that yourself.

1369
01:46:49,507 --> 01:46:51,069
You will not take her from me!

1370
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:55,537
Your anger and your lust
for power have already done that.

1371
01:46:59,357 --> 01:47:00,813
You have allowed this,

1372
01:47:00,938 --> 01:47:03,807
dark lord to twist your mind
until now...

1373
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:08,322
until now you have become the
very thing you swore to destroy.

1374
01:47:08,693 --> 01:47:10,148
Don't leture me, Obi-Wan.

1375
01:47:10,904 --> 01:47:12,831
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

1376
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:16,127
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1377
01:47:18,614 --> 01:47:19,988
I have brought peace,

1378
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,465
freedom, justice,

1379
01:47:23,034 --> 01:47:25,158
and security to my new empire!

1380
01:47:26,334 --> 01:47:28,149
Your new empire?

1381
01:47:29,209 --> 01:47:30,954
Don't make me kill you!

1382
01:47:32,552 --> 01:47:36,830
Anakin, my allegiance is
to the Republic, to democracy!

1383
01:47:37,966 --> 01:47:39,338
If you're not with me...

1384
01:47:41,177 --> 01:47:42,747
then you're my enemy.

1385
01:47:44,692 --> 01:47:47,146
Only a Sith deals an absolutes.

1386
01:47:49,747 --> 01:47:51,240
I will do what I must.

1387
01:47:53,004 --> 01:47:54,606
You will try.

1388
01:48:26,694 --> 01:48:30,532
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1389
01:48:30,976 --> 01:48:34,900
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1390
01:48:35,647 --> 01:48:37,183
Master Yoda.

1391
01:48:37,965 --> 01:48:39,566
You survived.

1392
01:48:40,304 --> 01:48:41,512
Surprised?

1393
01:48:42,858 --> 01:48:46,452
Your arrogance blinds you Master Yoda.

1394
01:48:47,171 --> 01:48:49,677
Now you will experience,

1395
01:48:49,678 --> 01:48:53,404
the full power of the dark side.

1396
01:49:35,765 --> 01:49:39,542
I have waited a long time,

1397
01:49:39,543 --> 01:49:41,534
for this moment.

1398
01:49:42,163 --> 01:49:46,338
My little green friend.

1399
01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:00,320
At last, the Jedi are no more.

1400
01:50:00,858 --> 01:50:03,920
Not if anything to say about it.

1401
01:50:04,312 --> 01:50:05,357
I have!

1402
01:50:10,076 --> 01:50:12,557
At an end your rule is.

1403
01:50:14,546 --> 01:50:16,566
And not short enough it was.

1404
01:50:21,624 --> 01:50:23,602
If so powerful you are...

1405
01:50:24,861 --> 01:50:26,573
why leave?

1406
01:50:28,044 --> 01:50:29,750
You will not stop me.

1407
01:50:30,109 --> 01:50:32,495
Darth Vader will become more,

1408
01:50:32,496 --> 01:50:34,611
powerful than either of us.

1409
01:50:35,133 --> 01:50:37,064
Faith in your new apprentice...

1410
01:50:37,585 --> 01:50:39,289
misplaced may be.

1411
01:50:40,569 --> 01:50:44,259
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1412
01:55:12,288 --> 01:55:13,106
Hurry.

1413
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:14,885
Careful timing we will need.

1414
01:55:15,393 --> 01:55:17,644
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1415
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,144
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1416
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:22,232
Then he's not dead.

1417
01:55:22,524 --> 01:55:23,969
Double your search.

1418
01:55:24,636 --> 01:55:26,316
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1419
01:55:27,629 --> 01:55:30,472
Tell Captain Kagi
to prepare my shuttle,

1420
01:55:30,497 --> 01:55:31,786
for immediate take off.

1421
01:55:32,035 --> 01:55:33,074
Yes, Master.

1422
01:55:33,379 --> 01:55:36,602
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1423
01:56:46,196 --> 01:56:47,486
Into exile...

1424
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:48,930
I must go.

1425
01:56:49,759 --> 01:56:51,363
Failed I have.

1426
01:58:31,158 --> 01:58:32,742
I have failed you, Anakin.

1427
01:58:33,595 --> 01:58:34,822
I have failed you.

1428
01:58:35,166 --> 01:58:38,024
I should have know the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1429
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:40,938
Anakin, Chancellor
Palpatine is evil!

1430
01:58:41,345 --> 01:58:43,619
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil!

1431
01:58:44,143 --> 01:58:45,580
Well, then you are lost!

1432
01:58:57,267 --> 01:58:59,400
This is the end for you
my master.

1433
01:59:24,328 --> 01:59:25,569
It's over, Anakin!

1434
01:59:26,218 --> 01:59:27,741
I have the high ground!

1435
01:59:30,408 --> 01:59:32,879
You underestimate my power!

1436
01:59:34,076 --> 01:59:35,319
Don't try it.

1437
01:59:58,197 --> 01:59:59,797
You we're the chosen one!

1438
02:00:01,606 --> 02:00:04,809
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1439
02:00:07,284 --> 02:00:08,981
Bring balance to the force!

1440
02:00:09,514 --> 02:00:11,157
Not leaving it in darkness!

1441
02:00:22,912 --> 02:00:24,573
I hate you!

1442
02:00:33,045 --> 02:00:34,429
You were my brother, Anakin.

1443
02:00:36,859 --> 02:00:38,217
I loved you.

1444
02:01:20,076 --> 02:01:21,428
Master Kenobi.

1445
02:01:21,453 --> 02:01:23,638
We have Miss Padmé on board.

1446
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:25,801
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1447
02:01:25,826 --> 02:01:28,076
We should leave this dreadful place.

1448
02:01:40,364 --> 02:01:41,536
Obi-Wan.

1449
02:01:44,050 --> 02:01:45,800
Is Anakin alright?

1450
02:02:54,689 --> 02:02:56,187
Your Majesty, this way!

1451
02:02:57,923 --> 02:02:59,011
There he is.

1452
02:02:59,769 --> 02:03:01,417
He's still alive.

1453
02:03:05,503 --> 02:03:07,136
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1454
02:03:07,245 --> 02:03:08,739
Yes, sir. Right away.

1455
02:03:45,519 --> 02:03:46,900
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1456
02:03:52,982 --> 02:03:54,861
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1457
02:04:11,907 --> 02:04:13,779
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly!

1458
02:04:44,879 --> 02:04:46,650
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1459
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:48,724
For reasons we can't explain...

1460
02:04:49,246 --> 02:04:50,432
we are losing her.

1461
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,825
She's dying?

1462
02:04:53,185 --> 02:04:54,259
We don't know why.

1463
02:04:54,798 --> 02:04:56,153
She has lost the will to live.

1464
02:04:57,157 --> 02:04:59,815
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1465
02:05:00,377 --> 02:05:01,392
Babies?

1466
02:05:01,862 --> 02:05:03,415
She's carrying twins.

1467
02:05:43,516 --> 02:05:45,351
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1468
02:05:46,025 --> 02:05:47,080
Luke.

1469
02:05:55,494 --> 02:05:57,066
Oh, Luke.

1470
02:06:03,431 --> 02:06:04,539
Boo-bah,

1471
02:06:04,926 --> 02:06:06,211
boo-bah.

1472
02:06:09,111 --> 02:06:10,244
Boo-bah.

1473
02:06:16,604 --> 02:06:18,394
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1474
02:06:19,276 --> 02:06:20,277
It's a girl.

1475
02:06:20,682 --> 02:06:21,684
Leia.

1476
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,271
Obi-Wan?

1477
02:07:11,182 --> 02:07:12,402
There's good in him.

1478
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:16,991
I know.

1479
02:07:17,648 --> 02:07:19,013
I know there is...

1480
02:07:20,474 --> 02:07:21,693
Still...

1481
02:07:56,654 --> 02:07:57,838
Lord Vader.

1482
02:07:59,685 --> 02:08:00,919
Can you hear me?

1483
02:08:04,724 --> 02:08:06,128
Yes, Master.

1484
02:08:09,161 --> 02:08:10,715
Where is Padmé?

1485
02:08:12,771 --> 02:08:14,136
Is she safe?

1486
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,592
Is she alright?

1487
02:08:19,544 --> 02:08:22,275
It seems in your anger,

1488
02:08:22,478 --> 02:08:24,253
you killed her.

1489
02:08:25,365 --> 02:08:26,226
I?

1490
02:08:26,444 --> 02:08:27,772
I couldn't have.

1491
02:08:28,426 --> 02:08:29,647
She was alive!

1492
02:08:29,803 --> 02:08:30,865
I felt it!

1493
02:08:51,318 --> 02:08:53,006
No!

1494
02:09:05,361 --> 02:09:06,888
Hidden, safe,

1495
02:09:06,913 --> 02:09:08,733
the children must be kept.

1496
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:12,569
We must take them
somewhere where the Sith,

1497
02:09:12,594 --> 02:09:14,068
will not sense their presence.

1498
02:09:16,708 --> 02:09:18,522
Split up they should be.

1499
02:09:19,670 --> 02:09:21,620
My wife and I will take the girl.

1500
02:09:22,863 --> 02:09:25,450
We've always talked of
adopting a baby girl.

1501
02:09:26,513 --> 02:09:27,851
She will be loved with us.

1502
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:30,768
And what of the boy?

1503
02:09:32,129 --> 02:09:33,325
To Tatooine.

1504
02:09:33,497 --> 02:09:35,064
To his family sent him.

1505
02:09:37,419 --> 02:09:39,510
I will take the child and watch over him.

1506
02:09:45,402 --> 02:09:47,181
Until the time is right...

1507
02:09:47,626 --> 02:09:48,927
disappear we will.

1508
02:09:51,458 --> 02:09:52,464
Master Kenobi.

1509
02:09:53,052 --> 02:09:54,138
Wait a moment.

1510
02:09:56,005 --> 02:09:58,620
In your solitude on Tatooine...

1511
02:09:59,122 --> 02:10:01,014
training I have for you.

1512
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:03,567
Training?

1513
02:10:04,395 --> 02:10:06,986
An old friend has learned the path...

1514
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:08,560
to immortality.

1515
02:10:10,527 --> 02:10:13,857
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1516
02:10:14,285 --> 02:10:16,342
Your old master.

1517
02:10:16,964 --> 02:10:18,076
Qui-Gon?

1518
02:10:20,891 --> 02:10:22,719
How to commune with him,

1519
02:10:22,821 --> 02:10:24,302
I will teach you.

1520
02:10:26,246 --> 02:10:27,250
Captain Antilles.

1521
02:10:27,575 --> 02:10:28,323
Yes, Your Highness?

1522
02:10:28,348 --> 02:10:30,067
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1523
02:10:30,091 --> 02:10:31,817
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1524
02:10:31,942 --> 02:10:33,642
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1525
02:10:33,997 --> 02:10:35,011
What?

1526
02:10:37,644 --> 02:10:38,920
Oh, no.

1527
